Not every school will allow or want a letter sent to them. Some may only require that you hit ‘Yes’ on a form in your application portal while others may not give any instructions at all. Always double check.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a school doesn’t give any specific instructions, you should always send a LOCI to confirm your commitment to a school. While chances are slim that you get off the waitlist, this letter can be the difference between acceptance and rejection. </span></p> <p><b>Guide to Your LOCI</b></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This guide is meant to give you a solid structure that works, but remember that real people read these letters. These people argue why you should come off the waitlist over another candidate. So get creative, make people laugh, cry, and reflect with you.</span></p> <hr /> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td style="width: 853.056px;"><span style="font-size: 16px;"><b>PA Points:</b></span></p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Length: 1 to 1.5 pages max</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ID: Include your name and any ID numbers, such as your Common App or School ID, in the header.

Patrick (a pseudonym) felt this pain on a chilly morning in 2020 after being rejected or waitlisted from almost all of his schools. Things looked grim, and we advised Patrick to write </span><b>letters of continued interest (LOCI)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to all of his waitlisted schools. To write was the last thing on Patrick’s mind, but to wait and do nothing while he could still do something was absolutely the wrong move. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patrick gathered up his remaining willpower to write a letter outlining how he has grown since submitting his application and why he believes the University of Chicago should be his future home. The day after Patrick sent the letter, an admissions officer from Chicago called him and offered a spot in the freshman class if he was willing to commit to Chicago right then and there. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patrick took the offer.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s take a look at Patrick’s letter. </span></p> <p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note: specific names have been edited for anonymity.</span></i></p> <p><b>Analysis</b></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dear University of Chicago Admissions,</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I sincerely hope that you and your families are safe and well. I was disappointed to have been placed on the waitlist; however, my commitment to The University of Chicago remains steadfast. If I am accepted, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I will submit my deposit, hang up my UChicago pennant, and plan my trip to Chicago for move-in day immediately</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Please allow me to reiterate my interest in The University of Chicago and share one final update here. </span></p> <hr /> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td><b><i>Introduction: </i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clearly and creatively stating his commitment to UChicago.</span></i></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <hr /> <p>Like many students, my senior year has been defined by the Covid-19 pandemic. While I’m disappointed that my graduation has been canceled and that I will not be able to spend the remainder of my senior year with my peers, this global crisis has driven me to grow both as a student and as a citizen. Local college closures left me as the sole intern in the district office of Congressman Clay Davis where I fielded calls from frightened constituents. The duties of an intern are often viewed as busy-work. However, I was able to alleviate fears and inspire hope by providing people with locations for Covid-19 testing sites, explaining why the government is promoting social distancing, and simply reminding them that there are people working hard everyday to ensure their safety and the safety of their loved ones. Since our office closed, I started volunteering at our local food shelter to help protect the most at-risk members of my community from having to put their lives on the line to get basic necessities. My experience serving my community during these extraordinary times has cemented my resolve to be a public servant.</p> <hr /> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td><b><i>Updates Pt. 1</i></b></p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The letter isn’t a list of his latest achievements, rather a description of how he has grown as a person since the last update.</span></i></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specific examples of actions he has been taking to help his community.</span></i></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Restating his driving intent and purpose.</span></i></li> </ul> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <hr /> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have remained dedicated to my scholastic pursuits and community, in two months I will graduate having received </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">straight A’s during my senior year and as a member of the Cum Laude society</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">More importantly, as the senior class president, I have worked to assuage the frustration and confusion that I’ve felt in my peers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Much like I did as an intern, I’ve served as a bridge between my school’s administration in New York and our seniors who have returned home around the world. I send regular updates about our yearbook, graduation, and our move to online schooling. It’s heartbreaking to know that we will not see each other for the rest of the year, but with the help of my peers, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve started to devise ways of holding senior events, like our commencement, over Zoom to maintain some sense of togetherness</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This crisis has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">taught me that regardless of one’s age or position in life, by being involved and offering a helping hand, anyone can have a positive impact on their community.</span></p> <hr /> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td><b><i>Updates Pt. 2</i></b></p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Academic update that reemphasizes his scholastic ability, rigor, and achievements</span></i></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than just a number, Patrick has responsibilities and duties that are important and impactful for his community.</span></i></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though he has submitted his applications, Patrick isn’t just coasting, he’s identifying problems in his community and thinking of novel solutions.</span></i></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reflection, the takeaway for his experiences that he has shared with the reader.

I side with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professor Goolsbee and his analysis of the recent $2 trillion economic aid package passed by our government</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

		contents : "<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Covid-19 pandemic has forced universities and colleges to reinvent the admissions process that hasn’t changed for many decades. Here’s what parents and students need to know about this unprecedented application year:</span></p> <p><b>The number of applications increased overwhelmingly at selective colleges</b></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to test-optional policies, applicants felt encouraged to apply to more competitive universities where standardized testing (SAT/ACT/SAT II) would have acted as a barrier before 2020. Many prestigious universities received so many applications that they had to delay decision release. </span></p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UCLA has topped the list of “schools with most applicants” for many years. But even that experience probably didn’t prepare the admissions office to evaluate nearly 140,000 applications, a 25% increase compared to the previous year.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harvard received over 57,000 freshman applications, a 43% increase.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MIT received 33,240 applications, a whopping 66% increase.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York University topped 100,000 applications for the first time, a 17% increase</span></li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>However, acceptance rates have never been lower</b></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3458" src="https://www.pointavenue.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1-1024x246.png" alt="" width="620" height="149" srcset="https://www.pointavenue.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1-1024x246.png 1024w, https://www.pointavenue.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1-300x72.png 300w, https://www.pointavenue.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1-768x184.png 768w, https://www.pointavenue.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1.png 1580w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The overwhelming increase in applications combined with deferred enrollment from the previous year plunged acceptance rates to unprecedented lows.</span></p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harvard: 3.4%</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Columbia: 3.7%</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Princeton: 4%</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yale: 4.6%</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UPenn: 5.7%</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MIT: 4%</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NYU: 12.8%</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Johns Hopkins: 5% (for Regular Decision applicants)</span></li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low acceptance rates also mean more rejected applicants than ever. A huge number of students have been offered spots on waitlists, a special kind of limbo that to some seems even more disappointing and confusing than an outright rejection. For students in that limbo, please check out this post: </span><a href="https://www.pointavenue.com/en/admissions-waitlist-what-is-it-what-do-you-do-next/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.pointavenue.com/en/admissions-waitlist-what-is-it-what-do-you-do-next/</span></a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>The confusion of test-optional policies</b></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Safety concerns forced cancellation of standardized testing worldwide. In an apt response, most schools adopted a test-optional or even test-blind policy and placed heavier emphasis on the actual application itself and letters of recommendation. However, that didn’t stop universities from heavily considering test scores.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amongst admitted students to the University of Pennsylvania during the early admissions round, over 75% still submitted their test scores. Before the pandemic, Dartmouth College “considered standardized test scores to be among the most important information alongside GPA, essays and class rank”&#8211;a signal that the student will be able to survive the academic rigor of the Ivy League institution. </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t want to admit someone who is going to struggle,” said Lee Coffin, dean of admissions at Dartmouth, to the Wall Street Journal. The smallest among the Ivies, Dartmouth admitted 6.17% of first-year applicants, the lowest in its history. </span></p> <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3459" src="https://www.pointavenue.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="288" /></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lee Coffin, Dartmouth’s vice provost for enrollment and dean of admissions and financial aid, signs letters to applicants being offered admission to the Class of 2025. (Source: Dartmouth website)</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Standardized test scores help demonstrate the academic performance of students, especially those coming from high schools that universities are unfamiliar with, i.e., most high schools outside of the United States. International students not achieving near perfect GPAs on globally recognized curricula like Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate are at a special disadvantage if they choose not to submit test scores, since admissions officers find it difficult to verify if the applicant will be able to keep up with college coursework.</span></p> <p><b>Conclusion</b></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2020-2021 was weird, to say the least. Our Harvard admit was rejected from UC Berkeley, Princeton admit was rejected from NYU. The prolonged effects of the pandemic and ever-changing college agendas promise an equally uncertain 2021-2022 application cycle. </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We recommend students and parents to start preparing early and not getting hyper-fixated on rankings and competitiveness of a school, but rather widening their search and consider factors such as: cultural fit, location, career outcomes, and of course, the likelihood of receiving enough financial aid or scholarships to fund your studies. It was the same strategy we provided for our Grade 12 students and we’re happy to say that they have all been admitted to at least 3 or more colleges, including MIT, Harvard, Columbia, Pomona, Emory, Duke, Davidson, Carnegie Mellon, London School of Economics, and more. </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have any questions or would like to schedule a 1-1 consultation, contact us today via Facebook or email at </span><a href="mailto:contact@pointavenue.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">contact@pointavenue.com</span></a></p>",		// 뉴스레터 내용,

		contents : "<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mid-March to May is an emotionally tumultuous time for high school seniors and their parents. Emails that start with “Congratulations” slowly find their way into email inboxes, only to be dwarfed by the “Sorry we don’t have better news” notifications and offers to be placed on their waiting lists.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First and foremost, we want to reiterate that an admissions decision is by no means indicative of your intelligence or how hard you’ve worked in the last four years. It’s natural to be sad and disappointed, but don’t beat yourself up or lose faith in your abilities. Take deep breaths, exhale, confide in people you trust, and plan next steps. It’s the only way forward.</span></p> <p><b><i>So what does it mean to be placed on a waitlist?</i></b></p> <ul> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The wait-list contains students qualified enough to be admitted, but the school simply doesn’t have enough spots available in its freshman class. There are instances where over-qualified applicants are waitlisted, since the school is certain those students will choose to attend a more competitive institution. Universities want to keep their “yield rate” (the percentage of students who were offered admissions and actually choose to attend) as high as possible. For example, West Point has a near-perfect yield rate of 98%, which means for every 100 acceptance letters they send out, 98 students enroll.

The odds are slim, and unpredictable. Schools can notify wait-list applicants of the final decision anywhere from May all the way to August&#8211;it feels like playing the lottery. A few schools may accept up to 30-40% of its waitlist students, like UC Berkeley, many others accept 0, like Colgate. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For more information, you can check out: </span><a href="https://www.collegetransitions.com/dataverse/waitlist-statistics"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.collegetransitions.com/dataverse/waitlist-statistics</span></a></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is waiting in limbo truly the best option?</span></p> <p><strong>2) If you accept your spot on the wait-list, immediately notify the school with a letter of continued interest (if allowed), and keep in regular contact with the admissions office:</strong></p> <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3421" src="https://www.pointavenue.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/on-wait-list-03.png" alt="" width="626" height="626" srcset="https://www.pointavenue.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/on-wait-list-03.png 626w, https://www.pointavenue.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/on-wait-list-03-150x150.png 150w, https://www.pointavenue.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/on-wait-list-03-300x300.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px" /></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this letter, you will reiterate your desire to attend the school and update them on recent achievements of yours, such as: stellar academic performance, new and improved standardized test scores, activities and competitions you continue to participate in, etc. While it’s natural to feel discouraged or disappointed, try to focus on the positive and show gratitude that the school is still considering your application.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colleges often have blog posts on how to deal with being wait-listed.

		contents : "<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">In preparation for Point Avenue&#8217;s upcoming Winter Intensive, our test prep instructors thought it essential to revisit our understanding of this fundamental skill and its relationship to academic preparedness. This winter session, as part of a holistic, inquiry-based teaching methodology, our team will be reinforcing uncompromising academic focus with that of rational exploration. Our destination? The induction and cultivation of critical thinking. Our vehicle? Two workshops on how to accomplish this. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">What exactly is meant when &#8216;critical thinking&#8217; is invoked as the root cause of or remedy for a student&#8217;s academic achievement or failure? An answer comes from an insightful sixth-grader at the Olympia School during a recent class discussion on a related topic. &#8220;Critical thinking means thinking deeper.&#8221; He isn&#8217;t wrong; essentially, that is what it is. However, a more precise definition is required if we are to examine the importance of thinking critically in correlation to mastering university placement tests such as the SAT and AP. </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <table style="width: 800px;"> <tbody> <tr> <td style="width: 790px;"><span style="font-size: 18px; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;"><img class="wp-image-2921 aligncenter" src="https://www.pointavenue.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/131656843_393353311929446_3349402453659320134_n.jpg" alt="" width="246" height="164" /></span></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">In logic, the object of study is reasoning. Logical thinking is an activity that students engage in–when they make claims, back them up with reasons, or make inferences and draw conclusions about what follows from a set of statements. Like many activities, reasoning can be done well, or it can be done poorly. The goal of logic is to distinguish sound reasoning from flawed reasoning. Once a student has become proficient at this, they have laid the groundwork for a life of &#8220;deep thinking,&#8221; i.e., critical thinking.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">Unquestionably, the value of such a process of thinking, especially in education, is evident. Still, how can critical thinking be induced across ELEM, MSHS, and particularly Test Prep programs? Apart from the consistent encouragement of diligence, productive study habits, and independent inquiry, critical thinking is a prerequisite to mastering standardized tests, whether that be language tests such as the IELTS or TOEFL, or concerning academic preparedness tests like the SSAT, ACT, SAT, and AP. </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style="font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;"><img class="wp-image-2922 aligncenter" src="https://www.pointavenue.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/131275248_383648242912942_7675429508135689914_n.jpg" alt="" width="479" height="319" /></span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">The most logical question then is; how do teachers and parents cultivate critical thinking in students? How do we instill such an analytical reasoning discipline in students who are deficient and develop it in students who already possess it? </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">First, we must provide students with the basics. A solid foundation in proper test understanding must be laid brick by brick or, more precisely, concept by concept by the instructor in tandem with the student. Second, we must continually promote an intellectual environment that encourages independent exploration and practice, creative inquiry, and rigorous repetition. </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">What do we mean by an intellectual environment? Where does thinking happen? That may sound like a silly question. Thinking, obviously, happens in our minds. But students do more than just think. They also share those thoughts. Opinions do not remain confined within our heads: we also express ourselves in our words and behavior. The ideas described and traded around in these ways and in these places, especially the more prevalent ideas, constitute the intellectual environment that we exist in. At Point Avenue, the environment our mentors strive to nurture and advocate for our students is paramount since it will impact how they view the world around them and fundamentally themselves.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style="font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;"><img class="wp-image-2918 aligncenter" src="https://www.pointavenue.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/131427216_821860685275909_6084706592186392872_n.jpg" alt="" width="475" height="317" /></span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">That leads us to another question; what exactly is a worldview? How are we guiding our students in building a dynamic, bold, and resilient one? A worldview is the sum of related answers to the most critical questions in life. Thus our worldview is intimately tied to our sense of who we are, how we want to live, and how we see our place in the world. Actively reinforcing our opinion of ourselves is essential since that sense of self will dictate how we respond to obstacles, whether academic or not.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">That leads us to critical thinking itself. Usually, logic and critical thinking skills are invoked in response to a need. And often, this need takes the form of a problem which can&#8217;t be solved until we gather information. Sometimes the problem is a practical one. &#8220;How do I spend my PA bucks?&#8221; In an academic environment, however, these problems are, of course, more distinct. &#8220;What did Timothy Matlack actually mean when he wrote The Declaration of Independence?&#8221; How do we guide our students in answering such questions on a standardized test? By helping them ask the right questions in return. </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">Perhaps more than problems do, good questions get the mind thinking. Questions express doubts, identify predicaments, call for solutions, and demand answers. Indeed we might not fully understand the nature of a given problem until we have asked a decent question about it. And here is where the symbiosis between teacher and students truly begins. To succeed and progress, students need to know their weaknesses and be unafraid to share that. Only then can we as teachers hone in on correcting gaps in students&#8217; reasoning process. How do we do this? We mentor our students in establishing good habits and, more importantly, avoiding detrimental habits such as intellectual laziness, saving face, peer pressure, etc. Instead, we encourage curiosity, courage, patience, and precision. </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style="font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2926" src="https://www.pointavenue.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/team.jpg" alt="" width="391" height="242" /></span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style="font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This winter, our instructors will focus on such techniques of rational inference and analytical judgme</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nt. These include the study of informal logic, traditional patterns of reasoning, and some distinctive analytical methods of inquiry to help students understand how to approach standardized tests. This course will provide students with the competencies that are requisite to success at university and life-long learning.</span></span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong><span style="font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">See you this December!</span></strong></p> <p><span style="font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Test Prep Team</span></em></span></p>",		// 뉴스레터 내용,

Of the 20 Point Avenue students who took part in this test, 13 students achieved a score of 1400/1600 and above. What’s more, 6 of them achieved an excellent score of over 1500/1600. Let&#8217;s have a quick look into the profiles of our 3 top scorers, and learn how they managed to score an impressive 1560 &#8211; 1550 &#8211; 1540, respectively.</span></p> <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2629" src="https://www.pointavenue.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/PA-Stars-SAT-1.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="512" /></p> <p><b>Ploy (1560/1600 SAT) &#8211; The Journey of Turning a 1400 to a 1560 during the pandemic</b></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ploy is an excellent student who excels in all areas. Throughout her high school years, she studied at Triam Udom Suksa School in Bangkok, Thailand. During the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, she still continued to attend the online SAT preparation classes with Mr. John Sohn from Point Avenue. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before studying with Point Avenue, Ploy took the SAT test several times and her maximum score was around 1400. She thought that she could never surpass the 1500 mark. However, after putting in immense effort during the SAT preparation courses at Point Avenue, including SAT 101, 201, and 301, Ploys&#8217; scores gradually improved. She developed the skills, appropriate test preparation strategies, and testing stamina. Her hard work finally paid off as she successfully conquered her SAT I test in August with a 1560/1600!</span></p> <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2628" src="https://www.pointavenue.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/PA-Star-Ploy-1560-SAT-1.png" alt="" width="512" height="512" srcset="https://www.pointavenue.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/PA-Star-Ploy-1560-SAT-1.png 512w, https://www.pointavenue.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/PA-Star-Ploy-1560-SAT-1-150x150.png 150w, https://www.pointavenue.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/PA-Star-Ploy-1560-SAT-1-300x300.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p> <p><b>Hoseong (1550/1600 SAT)</b></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hoseong is a student of British Vietnamese International School (BVIS) in Hanoi.

		contents : "<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">Our fast paced world requires people to constantly adapt and innovate. In 2020 alone, the world witnessed complex issues ranging from mitigating air pollution in cities to effective health responses to a global pandemic. Creativity, one of the 21st Century learning skills, is essential to nurture among children in order to better prepare them for the social and economical challenges of the future. Thus, creativity has the ability to help in future success (i.e. college and workplace readiness). Creativity has been valued throughout history, education, and culture. However, modern concepts and misinterpretations (myths) of teaching and enhancing creativity are still fairly new to parents, educators, and students. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">Dr. Myles Lynch, Ph.D. in Education from the University of New Hampshire, hosted a seminar on “Understanding and Nurturing Your Child’s Creativity” during the Point Avenue’s Mid-Autumn events. Dr. Lynch is passionate about supporting parents and educators who want to foster their children&#8217;s creative skills. During the seminar, parents learned how to cultivate their child&#8217;s creativity through a series of creative activities and suggestions. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">Creativity is a way of thinking differently, sometimes referred to as “thinking outside of the box”. Creativity varies from “Big C” or dealing with major world issues (i.e. pollution and poverty) to “Little C” in daily activities (i.e.navigating traffic, making meals, etc.). Interestingly, creativity is not age specific and it spans beyond purely arts and aesthetics and has more broad application towards fields such as math, science, and technology. Therefore, creativity is an ongoing process that involves more than purely risk-taking and individual work. Dr. Lynch explained that creativity is important because it promotes self-expression, critical thinking, problem solving, and at the same time reduces stress and boosts your mental health.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">Well-known techniques to be more creative included: brainstorming, frequent exercise, divergent thinking and the Wallas model were discussed. Additionally, Dr. Lynch summarized the following methods to nourish your children’s ingenuity in accordance with six elements of creativity: Risk/Courage, Play, Exploration, Collaboration, Perseverance and Social Context.</span></p> <p><span style="font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 21px;"><b>  1. Create a Space and Environment for Creativity</b></span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">Creativity is enhanced when a child is encouraged to think differently and let go of complete certainty. Children should be given the freedom to be divergent in their thoughts and parents should provide a safe environment to be different and experiment.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">Children’s screen time affects their creativity and is an aspect parents should consider. By limiting the amount of time spent using phones and watching TV, parents can make room for their children’s creative activities such as rehearsing a play, learning to draw, reading books, and creative self-expression. </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style="font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2559" src="https://www.pointavenue.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/cre.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="290" /><b></b></span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style="font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 21px;"><b>2.The Value of Play</b></span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">Parents and schools place a clear value and emphasis on learning in the form of getting good grades. However, unstructured play is an indispensable part of the development process. Parents are recommended to set up structured times and opportunities for unstructured, child-directed and imaginative play. In other words, when children are allowed to play freely, unencumbered by adults, they tend to be more creative and imaginative. </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style="font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 21px;"><b>3. Explore and Fail Without Being Judged</b></span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">As it takes courage to be creative and to fail, children should be encouraged by their parents and teachers to explore without being afraid of judgement and failure. An ideal environment for the development of creativity is when parents do not punish kids for providing an unexpected and potentially incorrect answer. Instead, parents should make sure their children feel comfortable experimenting and failing. In a creative environment, mistakes and failures are welcome as a part of the process and ‘weird’ or ‘strange’ answers should be encouraged.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">Furthermore, as much as creativity is against punishment, parents should also not reward their children for being creative. Rewards for creative behavior create incentives that are actually interfering with intrinsic motivation to create and may not be placing emphasis on being creative for its own sake. </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style="font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2561" src="https://www.pointavenue.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1333" /><b></b></span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style="font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 21px;"><b>4. Ask, Share and Collaborate</b></span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">Children should be given the opportunity to express and explain their creativity to different people. To enhance and encourage the creative process, parents need to ask and listen to what their child has to say with no judgement. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">Asking the right questions is very important, because not only does this help better understand their child’s thinking process, it also boosts their critical thinking and communication skills. Therefore, rather than focusing on the achievement, parents and educators should ask questions that emphasize the creative process and instill the habit of self-reflection on children such as “What did you like the most about this activity?” or “Did you have fun?”. Always focusing on the result of creativity takes away from the process of being creative in the first place. </span></p> <p><span style="font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adults as mentors should also integrate real-life issues and provide children with a chance to work with others and present their work to others. Creativity requires a level of social context and meaning outside of purely the classroom. Linking creative work to real world situations helps with intrinsic mot</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ivation.</span></span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <div id="attachment_2562" style="width: 476px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-2562 size-full" src="https://www.pointavenue.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Picture2.jpg" alt="" width="466" height="512" /><p class="wp-caption-text"><span style="font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"><em>                             Torrance Test for Creative Thinking</em></span></p></div> <p><span style="font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"><b>In conclusion, </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">fostering creativity for yourself and your children is no different from practicing a skill, planting a tree, or forming a healthy routine. Creativity takes the right mindset and a process of day-by-day work to master and refine. Therefore, creativity does not ‘just happen’ (like turning on a light switch) but rather takes years of work and progress to develop effectively. Dr. Lynch suggested that the earlier you start nurturing creativity for your child the better they will be prepared for the future demands of society. Adults have the opportunity to provide a creative environment for their child to help nurture the seed of innovation inside each person. Creativity must be allowed to grow using sufficient practice and an allowance for freedom.</span></span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"><b>REFERENCES</b></span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">Dewett, T.

		contents : "<p><span style="font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;"><b><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Introduction</span>:</i></b></span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;">Teaching children self-discipline is a priority and concern for most parents. With COVID-19’s resurgence, and the likelihood of having to return to online learning, parents recognize the importance and urgency of instilling discipline in children with regards to their academic studies. Unable to look after their students at all hours of the day, parents must trust and rely on their children to manage and complete their academic responsibilities without parental supervision.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;">Last Sunday, 2 August, Danny Hwang, Founder &amp; CEO of Point Avenue, led a webinar on “Lessons Learned from West Point: Why Teaching Self-Discipline to Children Now Matters More than Ever&#8221;. An alumnus of the United States Military Academy at West Point&#8211;an institution known for having produced many leaders in the military, public, and business sectors&#8211;Danny shared lessons learned from his time at West Point and guided parents on how to form discipline and healthy habits in children for lifelong success.</span></p> <p><span style="font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">From Danny, parents must teach the value and practice of discipline at a young age. Specific to this, Danny advised focusing on three core pillars: 1) </span><b>learning the value of hard work</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 2) </span><b>building healthy habits</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and 3) </span><b>investing for the future</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It goes without saying that children first look to their parents to understand what’s important and what to emulate. Parents must use this teaching opportunity and platform to share their values and beliefs.</span></span></p> <p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2396" src="https://www.pointavenue.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pa2-1.jpg" alt="" width="616" height="410" /></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style="font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;"><b>1.Learning the Value of Hard Work</b></span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;">As a child, Danny mowed the lawn as part of his house chores, often to the point where his hands blistered and bled. One time, Danny recalls asking his father if he could stop and rest his hands. To this, his father responded, “Put on gloves, and work until you’re done.” Danny’s parents used regular house chores to instill in their son two important life lessons. First, we must diligently work to grow and take care of all aspects of our life&#8211;whether this is mowing the lawn and studying for school exams or spending time with loved ones. It’s important that we spend time nurturing and building on what we have. Second, we must work to completion. That is, given a task and having developed a plan, we need to work to the best of our abilities to see that plan through. This is not saying that individuals shouldn’t take rest breaks or pivot when their plan fails. Danny’s parents wanted their son to understand the value of grit and not quitting. Nothing worth having comes easy.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style="font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;"><b>2.Building Healthy Habits</b></span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;">If hard work is a prerequisite for success, developing and maintaining healthy habits focused on academic preparedness, extracurricular exploration, and personal growth will enable an individual to more quickly reach their goals. It is discipline that takes a single act of hard work and turns it into a healthy habit. Discipline is a choice… our choice. It is a decision. Better yet, all of our decisions. From an early age, Danny’s parents helped him make the right decisions and form healthy habits&#8211;habits which he maintains to this day. Simple habits such as completing homework immediately after school, working out individually after sports practice, washing dishes after dinner, and taking out the trash before settling in helped Danny develop the will and discipline to survive the grind at West Point and thrive in a relentless environment. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;">More importantly, adopting these healthy habits enabled Danny to more quickly take control of his life and helped him navigate the many challenges that would come. The philosopher Aristotle once said, “We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, therefore, is not an act, but a habit.” With healthy habits firmly ingrained, Danny went on to achieve top scores at West Point, in addition to serving on the school’s student government and competitive skydiving team. </span></p> <p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2395" src="https://www.pointavenue.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pa1-1.jpg" alt="" width="598" height="398" /><b></b></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style="font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;"><b>3.Investing in the future</b></span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;">We generally all want the best things in life. More importantly, we want them now. It is important that parents help their students learn the value of patience and making decisions that forego short term gratification for long term rewards. Success is the sum of small efforts, repeated day-in and day-out. When Danny&#8217;s father promised him, &#8220;I’ll give you a penny for every page you read,&#8221; he did not intend for Danny to read for money. Instead, Danny’s father used this motivation to incentivize Danny to improve his reading comprehension, develop a deep reading habit, and explore a world of knowledge that would aid him in the future. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;">As parents, we need to help our students invest in their future and focusing their current efforts on: academic preparedness, extracurricular exploration, and personal growth.</span></p> <p><span style="font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;"><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Academic Preparedness</span>:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Parents must ensure that their students commit time to building foundational knowledge across all academic subjects, such as Math, Science, Language and Literature, and Social Science. We don’t need to force our children to be the best in every subject; however, they need to acquire basic knowledge to learn how to think critically and problem-solve. More effectively, parents must help their students identify their academic strengths and interests. Having identified both, we must encourage and support our children to take on more advanced and challenging courses related to those interests.</span></span></p> <p><span style="font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Extracurricular Exploration</b></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Parents must encourage and support their children to become leaders in their areas of interest. It’s important to encourage children to explore their interests by joining communities of like-minded people, such as school clubs, service organizations, sports teams, and academic competitions. It’s natural for students to sift in and out of different activities and communities as they are exploring. As parents, it’s important to support our children’s decisions; at the same time, we must teach our students about commitment and giving something an honest try. Upon joining an activity, it’s imperative that children remain committed to it for at least one year. This is the minimum time required to explore an activity and develop an informed opinion&#8211;on top of learning different roles and responsibilities.</span></span></p> <p><span style="font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;"><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Personal Growth</span>:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Parents must encourage and support their students to research, read about, and seek advice from experts in their children’s areas of interest. It’s important that we empower our students to take charge of their own learning by teaching them to be deliberate in how they grow their knowledge, skills, and experiences. Within their children’s communities, parents must encourage&#8211;sometimes challenge&#8211;their students to take up greater roles and responsibilities. In turn, this will help their children acquire new knowledge and skills, preparing them for future challenges and opportunities. Simultaneously, parents must open new doors for their students by helping them discover new opportunities outside of their communities to further aid their children’s personal growth. Overtime, and all together, these investments will help shape our students to become leaders in their areas of interest.</span></span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style="font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;"><b><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conclusion</span>:</i></b></span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;">With the pandemic resurging, and the high likelihood of returning to online learning, parents must help their students develop and maintain academic and personal discipline by establishing support systems. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;">We can’t expect our children to cope with this new learning environment and thrive without showing them what right looks like and how to succeed. It’s imperative that parents use the new academic year to explore different systems and processes to better support their students’ learning. To this end, setting clear expectations and reinforcing healthy habits are key. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;">Throughout our Summer Term, Danny and his online-based students initiated their morning classes at 6:30 AM with a high-intensity interval training workout. Exercising causes the body to release endorphins, triggering a positive feeling. Working out early doesn’t just improve our fitness, it helps us mentally prepare for the remainder of the day. Another key tip Danny shared with parents is to try and align their work schedule with their student’s learning schedule. Both parents and students should work in chunks (dedicated time blocks) and take rest breaks together. Children are more inclined to work when working alongside their parents. Additionally, this allows for both parents and students to catch up and relax together during their breaks and meals.  </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;">Lastly, Danny shared that parents must make time at the end of their day to recap their student’s learning and ensuing activities. It is not enough to allow teachers to teach and students to learn on their own. Parents must follow up with their children’s homework assignments, exam preparation, and overall learning progress. “Following up” doesn’t mean to simply ask students if they’ve completed their tasks. Rather, parents should use these opportunities to have the children teach what they recently learned (i.e. math concept, grammar rule, history lesson). This provides a check on learning and helps instill confidence.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;">The word “discipline” is often associated with “punishment”. At Point Avenue, we don’t believe that punishment, or negative reinforcement, is the most effective way to educate children. Rather, we teach that discipline is a choice to do the right thing and to invest in greater long term rewards. As parents, we must help our children develop and maintain discipline so that they are prepared to meet current and future challenges.</span></p> <p><span style="font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parents are invited to follow the official Point Avenue Facebook page at: </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/PointAvenue"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.facebook.com/PointAvenue</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get updates on our upcoming events.

The last day for test centers to confirm whether they will administer the August SAT is August 17.</p> <p>College Board recommends that students check directly with the test center, including the test center’s website, on the morning of the test.</p> <p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2380" src="https://www.pointavenue.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/12463099546878-1-1024x667.png" alt="" width="620" height="404" srcset="https://www.pointavenue.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/12463099546878-1-1024x667.png 1024w, https://www.pointavenue.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/12463099546878-1-300x196.png 300w, https://www.pointavenue.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/12463099546878-1-768x501.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></p> <p><strong>2/ Health &amp; Safety Measures </strong></p> <p>During the test, all students and staff have to wear a mask or protective face covering, and students must be seated at least six feet apart. When students arrive on the test day, the testing staff will conduct a short survey before letting students into a test center to determine if a student should be sent home due to sickness.</p> <p>The College Board encourages students who don’t feel well to stay home, and will transfer those students to another test date at no charge through September. If students would rather cancel their registration, the administration will issue a full refund.</p> <p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2381" src="https://www.pointavenue.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/12463099674301-1-1024x667.png" alt="" width="620" height="404" srcset="https://www.pointavenue.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/12463099674301-1-1024x667.png 1024w, https://www.pointavenue.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/12463099674301-1-300x195.png 300w, https://www.pointavenue.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/12463099674301-1-768x500.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></p> <p><strong>3/ Test Center Availability and Capacity </strong></p> <p>This year, many schools and test centers will have reduced capacity because of social distancing guidelines, and they may encounter unexpected closures. Because of public health restrictions and high demand, there is limited seating capacity for students testing in certain areas. While College Board cannot directly control capacity and test center availability, they will try to ensure that as many students as possible are able to test safely.</p> <p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2382" src="https://www.pointavenue.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/12463099769284-1-1024x667.png" alt="" width="620" height="404" srcset="https://www.pointavenue.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/12463099769284-1-1024x667.png 1024w, https://www.pointavenue.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/12463099769284-1-300x195.png 300w, https://www.pointavenue.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/12463099769284-1-768x500.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></p> <p><em>(Source: <a href="https://pages.collegeboard.org/sat-covid-19-updates">College Board</a>)</em></p>",		// 뉴스레터 내용,

		contents : "<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With summer approaching, parents are eagerly looking for productive and new activities their children will be excited about. Due to COVID-19, everyone has been forced to change their lifestyle and spend weeks (even months) inside their home. As a result, people have continued to endure social isolation from friends, family, and society. Social isolation can be detrimental to our physical, mental, and social health because humans crave interaction and new educational experiences. Our lives will never be the same after the recent pandemic but we must look ahead for ways to stay healthy, safe, and productive into the summer months. This article presents 5 productive activities you should consider for your child to support their physical, mental, and educational well being. These activities are important to consider to help mitigate the effects of social isolation and time spent away from the natural environment. </span></p> <p><b>1. Attend Summer Camp</b></p> <ol> <li style="list-style-type: none;"> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attendance at summer camp helps to support youth development through social, emotional, and experiential based learning.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Safety and health is always the highest priority and camps have a long history of planning for and managing communicable diseases. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">96% of children say that summer camp helped them to make new friends. 70% of parents say camp helped to build their child’s confidence and self-esteem.  (American Camp Association: </span><a href="https://www.acacamps.org/campers-families/because-camp/benefits-camp/value-camp"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Value of Summer Camp Research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Summer Camps provide creative activities which may include: drama, arts and crafts, talent shows, sports, games, field trips, water-based activities, and a technology free environment.</span></li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p><img src="https://www.pointavenue.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/2676817-01.png" alt="" /></p> <p><b>2. Day Trip with Family or Friends</b></p> <ol> <li style="list-style-type: none;"> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many families are choosing to spend their vacation closer to home due to health, safety, and restriction concerns associated with airport travel. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Day trips are a great way to do something fun and spend quality time with your family. For longer trips you should identify a place within 2 hours of your home to maximize time within an area. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Longer trips may include exploring neighboring cities or provinces. For example, from Hanoi you can drive to Bat Trang or Duong Lam craft villages, Quang Ninh, Hai Phong, Ninh Binh, or Ba Vi National Park.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Local day trips include: having a picnic at a park, visiting museums and mausoleums, going for an extended walk around your neighborhood. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I recommend using the Google Map line drawing feature to create and plan a trip: </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WX5gdxMKfgI"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drawing Lines and Shapes on Google Maps</span></a></li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p><img src="https://www.pointavenue.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/2676817-02.png" alt="" /></p> <p><b>3. Go Camping!</b></p> <ol> <li style="list-style-type: none;"> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Camping is a fun and unique experience for your child. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most important aspect of camping is safety and the importance to plan ahead for weather conditions and proper navigation of your destination. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should purchase the </span><a href="https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/ten-essentials.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">10 Essentials of Camping</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and know how to use each item in accordance with their function. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should learn about the essential tips for first time campers: </span><a href="https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/camping-for-beginners.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beginner Guide To Camping</span></a></li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p><img src="https://www.pointavenue.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/2676817-03.png" alt="" /></p> <p><b>4. Start a Hobby</b></p> <ol> <li style="list-style-type: none;"> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Life should not only be work and no play. Children should have passions beyond just academics, school sports, or extracurricular activities. When your child enters college (and eventually the workforce) having a hobby has been shown to support social wellness and networking capabilities.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hobbies begin as fun and playful and are a great way to develop passion and potential career goals </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/capitalbusiness/career-coach-the-value-of-hobbies/2013/05/03/ffa53f2c-b294-11e2-bbf2-a6f9e9d79e19_story.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Value of Hobbies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Example hobbies: Cooking, juggling, gardening, playing an instrument, learning magic tricks, starting a collection (cards, buttons, cups, etc).</span></li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://www.pointavenue.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/2676817-04.png" alt="" /></span></p> <p><b>5. Do Impactful Housework</b></p> <ol> <li style="list-style-type: none;"> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Housework, chores, and home projects can be meaningful and contribute to positive family life and bonding. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The summer is a perfect time to complete larger home projects with your child. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only will multi-day projects add value to your home they will also create lasting family memories you can look back for years to come. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Summer projects include: building an outdoor firepit, making patio chairs, creating a garden, building shelves, making small furniture for your home. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Examples of larger projects: </span><a href="https://www.thisoldhouse.com/yards/21018260/28-easy-summer-weekend-projects"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Summer Weekend Projects</span></a></li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p><img src="https://www.pointavenue.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/2676817-05.png" alt="" /></p> <p><b>Note:</b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> These activities are suggestions for your family. You should always follow the guidelines from your local authorities for health, safety, and travel restrictions.  </span></i></p> <p><b>Point Avenue Summer Camp 2020: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">After 3 months of staying at home due to COVID-19, this summer is a great opportunity for your child to accelerate their learning process and gain an edge over their peers.

There was only one and a half months left for me to apply to all of my 20+ colleges around the world, and I had underestimated the insane amount of work and research needed to finish the applications. It felt like mission impossible, but Jason really made it happen with his patience, work ethic, and well-managed time schedule.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;">Finally, I was accepted into my Early Decision school, as well as most of the schools I applied to during the Early Round. Jason was not only a good writing coach, but also an amazing listener. I was astonished by how all his advice and guidance, based on my many essay drafts, were able to connect all my ideas, life events, thoughts, and beliefs and weave them into one narrative so fluidly. It brought order and clarity to what felt like pure chaos.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;">Admittedly, I also developed a clearer understanding of myself throughout my time working with him. My growth and his trait of being a good listener, made a real and significant change to my whole application as he helped me figure out how to showcase my best authentic self. Working with him really made me feel all my efforts led to a perfect and positive result. I hope there will be future opportunities to work with Jason again because he not only helped me complete everything with the highest quality possible, but he also helped me learn about myself throughout the process. I would recommend Jason to anyone.</span></p>",		// 뉴스레터 내용,

		contents : "<p><span style="font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;"><strong>Dear Point Ave family,</strong></span></p> <p><span style="font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">don’t know how else I could start writing this other than by crying, because that’s how we started this journey. In the small TOONG office, I was scared of a gloomy future that required an overwhelming level of preparation. I also may or may not have gotten scared by a loud Mr. Tommy who shouted out of dedication and passion. But I came back because I was assured that PA was different and that the mentors had faith in me.</span></span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;">Indeed, PA is so different that I could spend days talking about everything here.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;">Just like cream puffs, you are incredibly sweet. Anytime I come to the office, I always feel welcome. Many adults tell us kids that “they have been there, in our shoes”. But I realized that “being there” doesn’t consist only of giving us a checklist to prepare, but really “being there” to understand our hopes and fears. You are always there for me even when I can do things by myself, simply to cheer me up and help me believe in myself more. No matter how busy you are, you are always smiling or working out in the gym, making you a great source of motivation and encouragement. You make it so easy for me to venture into new territory with the courage to fail, because I know you’ll always be there to pick me up and guide me through those failures. You never said it explicitly, but by observing the way you treat students and parents, I have learned how you instill “Character First” in your education: by embracing it yourselves.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;">One thing that I love and admire so much about Point Ave is the fact that everything is raw and real. You gave us everything you had, and you trusted us with everything you gave us.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;">PA is where I have learned the true definition of leadership. You are all busy but always willing to spend time with us. You taught me that great leadership isn’t based on a top-down system, but on collaboration and understanding.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;">PA is where I have learned to embrace differences and respect my own choices. Most people just see the tip of the iceberg. I was urged by PA mentors to look at matters from different perspectives, and I think I really have become a more accepting person, to other people and to myself. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;">PA is where learning never stops. I learned that choosing a major in university doesn’t mean I have no other choices, and growing up to be an adult doesn’t mean I will have all the answers.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;">PA is where the sun always shines, where everyone is smiling and hugging students, at the reception desk, the teacher’s room, and especially in the gym.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;">So yeah! Point Avenue is not an English center, and Point Avenue’s mentors are definitely not like most adults.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;">You never have to sugarcoat your profiles or students’ achievements. You are whoever we need you to be, and I can never thank you enough for that. I mean… cream puffs contain only butter, water, flour and eggs, yet they are the best dessert!</span></p> <p><span style="font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To an infinite number of cream puffs between PA and Y., and beyond</span>:</span></p> <p><span style="font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1034" src="http://www.pointavenue.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Thu-Yen.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="1000" /></span></p>",		// 뉴스레터 내용,

This was amazing for our whole team since we were juniors. I think that the reason that we won this medal was because of how we applied our knowledge in the debate competition learned from Point Avenue, such as how to construct an argument and to use proper structure in a rebuttal. This boosted our confidence in the matches when we knew exactly what to do&#8221; &#8211; <strong>Pham Duc Anh</strong></span></p> <p><span style="font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;">&#8220;One big positive thing in the competition was that we won against much older students. I really appreciate Point Avenue teachers spending time training us, so I want to say thank you!&#8221; &#8211; <strong>Tran Khanh Minh</strong></span></p> <p><span style="font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;">&#8220;We achieved our top 10 medals in World Scholar&#8217;s Cup &#8211; Tournament of Champions not only through our maximum effort but also through our extraordinary Point Avenue mentors, especially Mr. Tin. He actually sacrificed a lot of things for us, booking flights and cars to Yale to encourage and support us, time and energy, patience in waiting for us to persuade our school teachers in allowing him to go and support us. He designed and plan our techniques to fight in the WSC senior division clearly and effectively. He taught us to follow plans step by step. That extra effort makes Point Avenue mentors different from others.&#8221; &#8211; <strong>Tran Bang Linh</strong></span></p>",		// 뉴스레터 내용,
