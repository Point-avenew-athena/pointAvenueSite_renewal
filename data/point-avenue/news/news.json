"contents": "<div class=\"section_inner\"><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2016, the New York Times published a satire piece claiming Stanford University admitted no one to the class of 2020--a jab at the increasing “elitism” and incomprehensible low acceptance rate of the institution. Well, in the 2020-2021 application season, due to test-optional policy, that satire became pretty close to reality when HYPMS (Harvard, Yale, Princeton, MIT, Stanford) all accepted LESS than 4% of applicants. Crazy, right? Now, imagine that figure slashed in half when it comes to international students' acceptance rates and we are pretty close to 0.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every single year, these schools receive thousands of applications with perfect SAT / ACT and 4.0 from class presidents and valedictorians--but not all of them are accepted. So how do admitted applicants stand out? The answer is: by having an application spike.</span></p><p><b><i>Important disclaimer: </i></b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We don’t encourage making attending any particular institution your life goal, because you are worth so much more than a brand of a school. The most important aspects when picking schools are: cultural fit, strength of desired program, academic and financial feasibility. There are literally hundreds of phenomenal schools worth attending that are not in the “top 20”--whatever that “top X” even means. However, we advise our students the following because it’s helpful not just in college admissions, but also</span><b><i>leading a purpose-driven life.</i></b></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The following is extracted from the article <a href=\"https://blog.prepscholar.com/how-to-get-into-harvard-and-the-ivy-league-by-a-harvard-alum\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“How to get into Harvard and the Ivy League, by a Harvard alum,”</span></a> by Allen Cheng, Harvard alum and co-founder of PrepScholar:</span></p><br><hr><br><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">“Most students aiming for top schools make the <b> huge mistake of trying to be \"well rounded.\"</b></span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The typical student who wants to be well rounded will try to demonstrate some competency in a variety of skills. She'll learn an instrument, play a JV sport, aim for straight As, score highly on tests, volunteer for dozens of hours at a hospital, and participate in a few clubs.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In these students' minds, they're telling their schools, \"I can do everything! Whatever I set my mind to, I can learn to do a pretty good job. This means I'll be successful in the future!\"</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>This is wrong.</strong>The world doesn't see it this way, colleges like Yale and MIT generally don't see it this way, and far too many students waste thousands of hours in their lives pursuing this.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>To put it bluntly, \"well rounded\" means \"mediocre at everything.\" Jack of all trades, master of none.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Schools are looking for two main qualities in applicants:</span></p><ul><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students who are going to accomplish world-changing things.</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students who are going to contribute positively to their communities while in college and help other students accomplish great things as well.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This, of course, is hard to predict when you're just 17 years old. You've barely developed, you don't know exactly what you want to do with your life, and you have a lot of room to grow. But the college application process, as it's designed now, is the best way that colleges have to predict which students are going to accomplish great things.</span></p><p><b>Your job is to convince the school that you're that person. You need to prove that you're capable of deep accomplishment in a field. This is what your application ultimately must convey: that you are world class in something you care deeply about.</b></p><p><b>In other words, forget well rounded—what you need to do is develop a huge spike.”</b></p><hr/><p><i style=\"font-weight:700\">So what is an application spike?</i></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In simple terms, a spike is a demonstrated deep interest. If you’re an aspiring Entrepreneur, that can mean having your own business that brings in several thousand dollars in annual profits. If you’re an aspiring Diplomat, that can mean being on the national debate team and winner of dozens of national and international debate competitions. If you want to be a Scientist, that can mean participating in research opportunities with real college professors and being listed as a co-author on research papers. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re thinking to yourself, “That’s impossible,” we’re here to guarantee you that these endeavors are completely within your reach; because they are our students’ real activities! We also guarantee that these opportunities didn’t just fall into their laps. In fact, they had to hustle for YEARS and faced 5-10 failures for every 1 achievement. </span></p><p><i style=\"font-weight:700\">What if I’m applying soon and don’t have a spike?</i></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Firstly, list out everything you have been involved in since Grade 9: from school clubs, competitions, community events, personal projects to hobbies and seek out a common THEME. For example, if you find yourself as the Content & PR person for multiple organizations, it’s probably natural to assume you have an interest in Marketing, PR or Communications--that’s your theme!</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Secondly, now that you have identified the theme or themes, do yourself a favor and cut out anything that takes up a lot of time but doesn’t have any meaningful progress. If you want to be a Data Analyst but are devoting hours every week to Model United Nations because all your friends are doing it, that’s probably not the best use of time. Consider investing that time into completing a relevant and accredited professional certification, such as the <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science?utm_source=gg&utm_medium=sem&campaignid=2087860785&utm_campaign=10-IBM-Data-Science-ROW&utm_content=10-IBM-Data-Science-ROW&adgroupid=116274867101&device=c&keyword=&matchtype=b&network=g&devicemodel=&adpostion=&creativeid=506892807488&hide_mobile_promo&gclid=CjwKCAjwzMeFBhBwEiwAzwS8zLTlabVlonaelmPY6UcfY6hLx2q3nye3l0reNozG-UAWy9ZPa2gd2xoC_sUQAvD_BwE\" target=\"_blank\">IBM Data Science </a>one. <b>It’s never too late to improve yourself and learn new knowledge.</b> We always tell our students: we will never judge you based on where you go to school, but always on your work ethic and desire to learn. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, putting everything together on your Activities Profile: On the Common Application, you have 10 slots for activities and 150 characters to describe them. Make sure to use strong action verbs and be precise. The truth is Admissions Officers only spend 6 minutes to read a complete application: from your activities, essays, transcripts, test scores to letters of recommendation. If your activities profile doesn’t tie in with the rest of your application and desired field of study, schools will find it hard to define your brand and decide if you’d be a good fit. </span></p><p><i style=\"font-weight: 700\">Final Words</i></p><p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/23/books/review-in-where-you-go-is-not-who-youll-be-frank-bruni-examines-college-admissions-mania.html\" target=\"_blank\">Where you go is not who you’ll be,</a> but we hope the above guide has proven some useful insights to help you navigate the increasingly confusing and competitive college admissions landscape.  </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">To receive additional help, don’t hesitate to reach out to us via our Facebook page and <a href=\"mailto:contact@pointavenue.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">contact@pointavenue.com</span></a>; or better yet, join our 3-workshop series designed to get you started on the US college application process, including: the activities profile, personal statement, and building a successful schools list.

I just finished my Math class and was looking forward to playing some games on the computer. That was when I saw the congratulatory letter in my inbox. I just burst out with joy, and started jumping around the house to celebrate.” </span></p> <p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-3623\" src=\"https://paathena-public-prod.s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/pasted-image-0-1024x877.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"531\" srcset=\"https://paathena-public-prod.s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/pasted-image-0-1024x877.png 1024w, https://paathena-public-prod.s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/pasted-image-0-300x257.png 300w, https://paathena-public-prod.s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/pasted-image-0-768x658.png 768w, https://paathena-public-prod.s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/pasted-image-0.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" /></p> <p><b>Choosing Villanova because he wants to &#8216;contribute to our society'</b></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having received admissions letters from multiple universities, Lam decided to choose Villanova in pursuit of a Computer Engineering degree, even though that major is not the school's greatest strength. What impressed Lam about Villanova, however, is the way the school places a strong emphasis on humanity in its curricula. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t want to just learn about computer science or coding, I want to know how I can use technology to contribute to the betterment of our society and bring values to the community. I believe Villanova is the perfect place for me to make my dreams come true.” When asked about his ambitions, Lam dreams of making our life and work in cities ‘smarter’ and ‘better’ through innovation. </span></p> <p><b>A Heart for Science, and a Head among the Clouds</b></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lam began exploring his options to study abroad from Grade 10 and started his application plan then. Despite starting a bit later than the rest of the class, Lam quickly identified his profile-building strategy, which he called the \"inverted triangle&#8221;. He first focused on getting the ideal score on the two important standardized tests, IELTS and SAT. After two months of rigorous study, the boy from Hanoi-Amsterdam achieved his goals with 1500 SAT and 8.0 IELTS. With a solid academic foundation, Lam took the time to explore life around him and opened himself up to new and meaningful experiences.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although Lam started out majoring in Physics, he soon took great interest in computer hardware and software and oriented himself in Computer Engineering. In addition to participating in clubs at school, Lam determined that he wanted to build a profile of extracurricular activities in STEM. He actively took advantage of the relationships he had with people working in the industry. Eventually, he was directly involved in a research project with the Vietnam Academy of Sciences and published a research paper. He went on to win the Gold medal in the International Artificial Intelligence Innovation Contest 2019 - 2020.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond his interest in Science, Lam is a very lively individual. He enjoys taking time to explore the streets to discover different life stories. It is these moments that have become the endless inspiration that Lam conveys in his university application essays.</span></p> <p><b>Know how to find help to turn dreams into reality</b></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Lam first arrived at Point Avenue, the Early Decision deadline was very close. He was full of ideas but did not know how to present them logically and convincingly in his university application. After a consultation session with his mentor - Mr. John, Lam began working on completing his application. He quickly became a familiar face at our office. He could easily be found at the table editing away his essay, or taking his rest time to stretch it out in the gym. Although his time studying at Point Avenue was not too long, Lam really found his place within our community, and along with it valuable memories. </span></p> <p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-3624\" src=\"https://paathena-public-prod.s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/pasted-image-0-1-769x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" srcset=\"https://paathena-public-prod.s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/pasted-image-0-1-769x1024.jpg 769w, https://paathena-public-prod.s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/pasted-image-0-1-225x300.png 225w, https://paathena-public-prod.s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/pasted-image-0-1-768x1022.jpg 768w, https://paathena-public-prod.s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/pasted-image-0-1.jpg 1202w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" /></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I truly cherish my time spent with Mr. John Fujita.

Mr. John then taught him to raise big questions about life from those seemingly trivial questions, and weaved them into essays as he gave his personal opinion to questions including: “How does color perception affect reason and emotions?” or “Why are all occupations equally important?”</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Talking about his application process, Lam refers to it as a unique and meaningful experience, where he had the chance to explore his interests. He firmly believes that it is not necessary to go to a top-tier school. It is better to go to a school that matches your career orientation, personality, and ability. On the school side, each school will also have its own \"taste&#8221; for selecting students and can completely reject qualified candidates for many different reasons. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though he just finished an exhausting university application, Lam is already working on his next steps. He is preparing himself to make new connections and to face new opportunities and challenges in his path to America.    </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If I could give you one piece of advice, I would tell you to just go out and explore, do things from the heart, and never turn down any opportunity to grow.” </span></p> "

To write was the last thing on Patrick’s mind, but to wait and do nothing while he could still do something was absolutely the wrong move. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Patrick gathered up his remaining willpower to write a letter outlining how he has grown since submitting his application and why he believes the University of Chicago should be his future home. The day after Patrick sent the letter, an admissions officer from Chicago called him and offered a spot in the freshman class if he was willing to commit to Chicago right then and there. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Patrick took the offer.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let’s take a look at Patrick’s letter. </span></p> <p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Note: specific names have been edited for anonymity.</span></i></p> <p><b>Analysis</b></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dear University of Chicago Admissions,</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I sincerely hope that you and your families are safe and well.

While I’m disappointed that my graduation has been canceled and that I will not be able to spend the remainder of my senior year with my peers, this global crisis has driven me to grow both as a student and as a citizen. Local college closures left me as the sole intern in the district office of Congressman Clay Davis where I fielded calls from frightened constituents. The duties of an intern are often viewed as busy-work. However, I was able to alleviate fears and inspire hope by providing people with locations for Covid-19 testing sites, explaining why the government is promoting social distancing, and simply reminding them that there are people working hard everyday to ensure their safety and the safety of their loved ones. Since our office closed, I started volunteering at our local food shelter to help protect the most at-risk members of my community from having to put their lives on the line to get basic necessities. My experience serving my community during these extraordinary times has cemented my resolve to be a public servant.</p> <hr /> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td><b><i>Updates Pt. 1</i></b></p> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The letter isn’t a list of his latest achievements, rather a description of how he has grown as a person since the last update.</span></i></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Specific examples of actions he has been taking to help his community.</span></i></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Restating his driving intent and purpose.</span></i></li> </ul> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <hr /> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have remained dedicated to my scholastic pursuits and community, in two months I will graduate having received </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">straight A’s during my senior year and as a member of the Cum Laude society</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More importantly, as the senior class president, I have worked to assuage the frustration and confusion that I’ve felt in my peers</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

What Do You Do Next?</span></a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>The confusion of test-optional policies</b></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Safety concerns forced cancellation of standardized testing worldwide. In an apt response, most schools adopted a test-optional or even test-blind policy and placed heavier emphasis on the actual application itself and letters of recommendation. However, that didn’t stop universities from heavily considering test scores.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amongst admitted students to the University of Pennsylvania during the early admissions round, over 75% still submitted their test scores. Before the pandemic, Dartmouth College “considered standardized test scores to be among the most important information alongside GPA, essays and class rank”&#8211;a signal that the student will be able to survive the academic rigor of the Ivy League institution. </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t want to admit someone who is going to struggle,” said Lee Coffin, dean of admissions at Dartmouth, to the Wall Street Journal. The smallest among the Ivies, Dartmouth admitted 6.17% of first-year applicants, the lowest in its history. </span></p> <p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3459\" src=\"https://paathena-public-prod.s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"512\" height=\"288\" /></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lee Coffin, Dartmouth’s vice provost for enrollment and dean of admissions and financial aid, signs letters to applicants being offered admission to the Class of 2025. (Source: Dartmouth website)</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Standardized test scores help demonstrate the academic performance of students, especially those coming from high schools that universities are unfamiliar with, i.e., most high schools outside of the United States. International students not achieving near perfect GPAs on globally recognized curricula like Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate are at a special disadvantage if they choose not to submit test scores, since admissions officers find it difficult to verify if the applicant will be able to keep up with college coursework.</span></p> <p><b>Conclusion</b></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2020-2021 was weird, to say the least. Our Harvard admit was rejected from UC Berkeley, Princeton admit was rejected from NYU. The prolonged effects of the pandemic and ever-changing college agendas promise an equally uncertain 2021-2022 application cycle. </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We recommend students and parents to start preparing early and not getting hyper-fixated on rankings and competitiveness of a school, but rather widening their search and consider factors such as: cultural fit, location, career outcomes, and of course, the likelihood of receiving enough financial aid or scholarships to fund your studies. It was the same strategy we provided for our Grade 12 students and we’re happy to say that they have all been admitted to at least 3 or more colleges, including MIT, Harvard, Columbia, Pomona, Emory, Duke, Davidson, Carnegie Mellon, London School of Economics, and more. </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have any questions or would like to schedule a 1-1 consultation, contact us today via Facebook or email at </span><a href=\"mailto:contact@pointavenue.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">contact@pointavenue.com</span></a></p>"

It’s natural to be sad and disappointed, but don’t beat yourself up or lose faith in your abilities. Take deep breaths, exhale, confide in people you trust, and plan next steps. It’s the only way forward.</span></p> <p><b><i>So what does it mean to be placed on a waitlist?</i></b></p> <ul> <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The wait-list contains students qualified enough to be admitted, but the school simply doesn’t have enough spots available in its freshman class. There are instances where over-qualified applicants are waitlisted, since the school is certain those students will choose to attend a more competitive institution. Universities want to keep their “yield rate” (the percentage of students who were offered admissions and actually choose to attend) as high as possible. For example, West Point has a near-perfect yield rate of 98%, which means for every 100 acceptance letters they send out, 98 students enroll. By comparison, Stanford’s and Harvard’s yield rates are both 82% (statistics from 2019.)</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a significant number of admitted students don’t enroll, the admissions team will offer acceptances to wait-listed candidates. Universities will NOT notify waitlist students till May or much later.</span></li> </ul> <p><b><i>What do you do next? Refer to the pictures below for more information.</i></b></p> <p><strong>1) Assess your options:</strong></p> <p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3420\" src=\"https://paathena-public-prod.s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/on-wait-list-02.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"626\" height=\"626\" srcset=\"https://paathena-public-prod.s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/on-wait-list-02.png 626w, https://paathena-public-prod.s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/on-wait-list-02-150x150.png 150w, https://paathena-public-prod.s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/on-wait-list-02-300x300.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px\" /></p>  <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is the wait-list school truly a top-choice school? The odds are slim, and unpredictable. Schools can notify wait-list applicants of the final decision anywhere from May all the way to August-it feels like playing the lottery. A few schools may accept up to 30-40% of its waitlist students, like UC Berkeley, many others accept 0, like Colgate. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For more information, you can check out: </span><a href=\"https://www.collegetransitions.com/dataverse/waitlist-statistics\" target='_blank'><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://www.collegetransitions.com/dataverse/waitlist-statistics</span></a></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is waiting in limbo truly the best option?</span></p> <p><strong>2) If you accept your spot on the wait-list, immediately notify the school with a letter of continued interest (if allowed), and keep in regular contact with the admissions office:</strong></p> <p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3421\" src=\"https://paathena-public-prod.s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/on-wait-list-03.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"626\" height=\"626\" srcset=\"https://paathena-public-prod.s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/on-wait-list-03.png 626w, https://paathena-public-prod.s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/on-wait-list-03-150x150.png 150w, https://paathena-public-prod.s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/on-wait-list-03-300x300.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px\" /></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this letter, you will reiterate your desire to attend the school and update them on recent achievements of yours, such as: stellar academic performance, new and improved standardized test scores, activities and competitions you continue to participate in, etc. While it’s natural to feel discouraged or disappointed, try to focus on the positive and show gratitude that the school is still considering your application.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Colleges often have blog posts on how to deal with being wait-listed.

Are you trying to finish school as fast as you can to work? </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; margin-left: '2rem';font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\">Here are some important considerations:</span></p> <b style=\"font-size: 18px; margin-left:2rem\">1. Tuition & fees</b><p style='margin-top: 2rem'><span style=\";margin-top: 2rem;font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\"><b style='font-size: 16px'>~$40,000 - $60,000 USD per year</b>. UK university tuition will range anywhere from <b>~$14,000 - $53,000 USD per year</b>. These figures are both for international students.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\">On the face of things, UK university does appear cheaper overall, but there are some other caveats you should consider. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\">As an international student, in the US, your tuition will be higher because you pay ‘out-of-state’ tuition rates. If you are hoping to attend a state or public school, like the University of California schools, you will NOT be eligible for any financial aid. As a government-funded school, aid cannot be legally distributed to international students, only domestic students. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\"><b style='font-size: 16px'>However, private schools and liberal arts colleges in the US do not have such restrictions and are much more generous to international students (especially liberal arts colleges). This can cut down the total cost you will pay to attend the school by half or more if you secure aid and scholarships. Of course, you will need to prove yourself a worthy investment.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\">For UK schools, the cost varies widely because their course fees are dependent on your major or field of study. In general, social sciences will cost less while science courses will be on the higher end to pay for laboratories and clinicals. UK schools also don’t have a common financial aid policy or platform, and give out very limited scholarships for undergraduate programs.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\">Remember that this is tuition, and not the total cost of attendance to these schools. Depending on the location of your university, additional fees, cost of living, and your personal spending can range from $10,000 to as much as $25,000 per year. Big cities like New York, Los Angeles, and London will be considerably more expensive than Dallas or Liverpool.</span></p> <b style='margin-left: 1rem'>2. Length of Study</b><p style=\"margin-top: 2rem;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\">Typically in the US, your undergraduate degree will take 4 years to complete. On the other hand, in the UK, your degree will take 3 years to finish. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\">That’s another important consideration when thinking about how much money you’re spending on school. Finishing school early means you save money and can start working and making money earlier. However, having an extra year in college can be a valuable time to expand your social circle, take advantage of university resources, and continue exploring your interests.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\">After all, you have the rest of your life to work, but you’ll (probably) only attend college once!</span></p> <b style='margin-left: 1rem'>3. Choosing Your Major</b><p style=\"margin-top: 2rem;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\">In the US, most schools have a liberal arts philosophy to their curriculum and require students to take a broad range of general education classes before officially declaring a major, usually in your 2nd year. Additionally, it’s very normal for students to change majors multiple times throughout college as they experiment and explore different interests. Students are also allowed to pick a minor and second or even third major. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\">In the UK, however, you are required to choose and commit to a major during your application process. Instead of taking a broad range of classes, you will begin to study your specific major immediately. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\">Consider your life. Are you already decided on your field of passion and want to get started right away? Or are you looking to wander for a little bit and see what life has to offer you?</span></p> <b style='margin-left: 1rem'>4. Application Systems, Strategy, and Timeline</b><p style=\"margin-top: 2rem;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\">Both countries have their own application systems and differences in what they emphasize when considering applicants. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\">The US and Common App</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\">In the US, for most colleges, you will use the Common App portal to apply to universities. While there are independent systems, like the University of California, or the Coalition for Access application, most likely, you will use the Common App. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\">In the Common App, you will fill out your personal information, activities, honors, test scores, and academics. Additionally, there is the infamous 650-word Personal Statement and every school will usually have 1-4 supplemental essays. Americans love a good story and leadership, and your application and essays should be communicating a compelling narrative about who you are. The Personal Statement is NOT a retelling of your resume, but a personal narrative about your life, who you are, your worldview, what you’ve learned and how you’ve grown.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\">US universities and colleges practice “holistic admissions,” meaning they evaluate a variety of factors, from academics, test scores, teacher evaluations, essays, to financial situation, ethnicity, and demonstrated interest in the university. Every piece of your application should come together like a beautiful puzzle revealing aspects of your history and personality.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\"><img class=\"wp-image-2922 aligncenter\" src=\"https://paathena-public-prod.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/article2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"479\" height=\"319\" /></span></p>  <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\">In the UK, you will use the UCAS system for the application and it is a much more straightforward affair compared. While UCAS also asks for activities and experience, it is a much smaller part of the application.While you are also asked to write a Personal Statement, they aren't looking for a creative essay necessarily. Instead, the entire application process places a higher emphasis on academic and theoretical knowledge, and your essay should clearly speak to your strengths in those areas. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\">Most UK schools have minimum academic entry requirements depending on the major, and the more popular or scientific the major, the higher the requirements. For example, to be considered for the Economics program at the London School of Economics and Political Science (commonly known as LSE), students will need to have one of the following:</span></p> <ul><li>A-levels: A*AA with an A* in Mathematics</li><li>IB: 38+/45, including 766 in higher level subjects, with 7 in Mathematics</li><li>AP: five APs at grade 5 and a minimum GPA of 3.7</li></ul><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\">Remember, this is just the minimum academic requirements to be considered. Accepted applicants usually score higher than this.</span></p>  <p><span style=\"font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\"><img class=\"wp-image-2918 aligncenter\" src=\"https://paathena-public-prod.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/article3jpg.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"475\" height=\"317\" /></span></p>  <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\">There’s a lot to think about, so here’s a handy chart to go over some of the biggest differences:</span></p><table style='width:100%'><tr><th></th><th>US</th><th>UK</th></tr><tr><td>Tuition</td><td>Avg. ~$40,000 - $60,000 USD per year</td><td>Avg. ~$14,000 - $53,000 USD per year</td></tr><tr><td>Financial Aid</td><td>V</td><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>Financial Aid</td><td>V</td><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>Length of Study</td><td>4 years</td><td>3 years</td></tr><tr><td>Choosing Your Major</td><td>Can change major multiple times and pick up a minor, second or third major</td><td>Commit to major from the beginning.

Changing means restarting</td></tr></table> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\">But not everything! These are some important factors to consider when considering schools between the US and the UK, but like most things in life, it is highly dependent on you as a person and your goals and preferences.</span></p>  <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\">If you have more questions about your specific situation, please reach out to us and ask away!</span></p>"

Days are long and summers are short, filled with scraped knees and candy dreams. I am certainly grateful for the happy childhood that my parents were able to provide me, and no doubt you parent readers are doing the same. </span></p>  <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\">Yet times have changed and the world is an increasingly competitive place, and you know that while time is long to a child, you know that there is always less time than you think there is. When I was a kid growing up in California, I went to public school and never even considered boarding school. Thankfully, my experiences and support were still enough to help me get into UCLA. However, college admission has become exponentially more competitive since my days, and parents are always looking for ways to best elevate their children’s chances of getting into good universities. For many families in Asia, they consider the best platform to be boarding schools. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\">Parents often come to Point Avenue asking about boarding school options for their children, even ones as young as 8-years-old, and how that will shape their future. And we always tell them, boarding school considerations are even more multifaceted and complicated than university considerations. Boarding schools are amazing for some, but maybe not a good fit for others. So how can you know if boarding school is right for your child and family?</span></p><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style=\"width: 50%;\" class=\"wp-image-2921 aligncenter\" src=\"https://paathena-public-prod.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Pve+2-01.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"246\" height=\"164\" /></div><b style=\"font-size: 18px; margin-left:2rem\">1. Is your family ready for the cost of boarding schools?</b><p style=\"margin-left: 4rem;\"><span style=\";font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\"><p style=\"margin-top: 2rem;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\">Boarding school is an expensive investment, usually even more than college itself! The average cost is anywhere from $60,000 - $75,000 USD PER YEAR! And often even higher when you start factoring in incidental costs for special programs and other miscellaneous expenses.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\">And as an international student, it’s very difficult to receive financial aid at well-known institutions! The reality is that international students are a source of money for boarding schools and their aid is reserved for domestic students. Of course, we are aware of a few boarding schools that give out significant amounts of scholarships and aid to attract students. While I can’t comment on the quality of all institutions, I would urge you to find all information you can about their course offerings, extracurricular opportunities offered, student life, and matriculation results--the universities their students attend after graduation.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\">It’s a shocking cost and if you’re wondering whether to spend your money on boarding school or university, save your money for university. Once a university sees that you are spending that much for a high school education, they will also expect you to pay that for the university as well. </span></p><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style=\"width: 50%;\" class=\"wp-image-2921 aligncenter\" src=\"https://paathena-public-prod.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Pve+2-02.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"246\" height=\"164\" /></div><b style='font-size: 18px;margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem'>2. Who is making this decision?</b><p style=\"margin-top: 2rem;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\">This is always a question I must get answered when talking to families about boarding school. It’s not unusual to have students and families come to me and the student has no idea why they are meeting a stranger who is asking them dozens of questions about themselves and their future. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\">When it comes to boarding school, the most important thing to consultants and the schools themselves is that it’s the student that wants to apply and attend boarding school. The boarding school application process is very complicated and stressful for the entire family, and if the student isn’t internally motivated to apply, it’s going to be downright painful. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\">This isn’t just a decision for your child, it should be a decision made with your child. </span></p> <div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style=\"width: 50%;\"  class=\"wp-image-2921 aligncenter\" src=\"https://paathena-public-prod.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Pve+2-03.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"246\" height=\"164\" /></div><b style='font-size:18px;margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem'>3. “Why do you want to go to a boarding school?”</b><p style=\"margin-top: 2rem;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\">This is a question asked by almost every single boarding school, whether in an essay prompt or in an interview.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\">Not only is it important for the child and family to be in agreement, it’s also important to be able to articulate why you want to go to boarding school at all. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\">If the only reasons to go to a boarding school are to get away from parents or have a better chance at a “top” university, I don’t consider that a great reason to go to boarding school, however true that may be. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\">If your reasons include meeting a diverse group of students and adults, taking advantage of unique course offerings and special programs, smaller and immersive communities, accessibility to teachers and mentors, and living independently–boarding school might be right for you!</span></p><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style=\"width: 50%;\" class=\"wp-image-2921 aligncenter\" src=\"https://paathena-public-prod.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Pve+2-04.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"246\" height=\"164\" /></div> <b style='font-size:18px;margin-left: 1rem;margin-bottom:1rem'>4. Is your child ready for boarding school?</b><p style=\"margin-top: 2rem;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\">Related to being independent, here’s another important consideration: is my child mature enough to live independently in a foreign country and school?</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\">Of course, a big reason to go to boarding school in the first place is to become more independent, but also consider that not all students are ready for the truly big shock that a change like this can bring. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\">In most cases, boarding school applicants are 13-14 years old. They will be away from friends and family, plunged into a new academic environment, manage their calendar and activities on their own, etc.Boarding schools do their best to provide their students with attention and support, but there’s also a limit to what they can do. Be realistic and honest about your child. And just because they may not be ready for boarding school doesn’t mean anything is wrong, we are all individuals that move at our own pace and needs.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\">This is a big reason why boarding schools prefer students who repeat 9th grade, as in they apply in 9th grade and then start boarding school in 9th grade again. The majority of international, especially Asian, students are all repeaters. This means they are more developed in academics and extracurricular activities, as well as being more mentally, emotionally and physically mature. In the past, we have had top boarding schools communicate that while students applying from grade 8 to grade 9 are certainly welcomed, the schools will evaluate their maturity level extra carefully in the interviews to make sure they can keep up with the older peers.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\">Additionally, is your child ready academically? Boarding schools are known for their rigorous and extensive curriculum, where students are expected to challenge themselves, deep dive into current interests, as well as explore new ones. This is why boarding school students are reported as more academically prepared for colleges than the average student. How ready is your child to tackle these subjects in 100% English? Do they know to proactively seek help from teachers and peers when they struggle? Do they have good study habits, or do you have to monitor them every night so they will finish their homework?</span></p><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style=\"width: 50%;\" class=\"wp-image-2921 aligncenter\" src=\"https://paathena-public-prod.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Pve+2-05.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"246\" height=\"164\" /></div><b style='font-size:18px;margin-left: 2rem;margin-bottom:1rem'>5. So, how can you help prepare your child for boarding school?</b><p style=\"margin-top: 2rem;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\">If you’ve made it this far and feel reassured that boarding school is the right option, that’s wonderful! There are a few different ways to prepare your child for the process up ahead.</span></p> <p style=\"margin-left: 6rem;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\"><b>1/ Build a strong foundation in Mathematics and English:</b> With strong academics, your child will feel prepared to take on any required standardized tests that come their way, whether that’s the SSAT, TOEFL/IELTS or any placement exam designed by the schools themselves. Additionally, most boarding schools require a letter of recommendation from the student’s English and Math teachers, where they will rate the applicant's academic aptitude and readiness. </span></p> <p style=\"margin-left: 6rem;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\"><b>2/ Explore extracurricular activities:</b> It’s no secret that boarding schools love students that can contribute to their community. Encourage your child to develop their interests, whether that’s in the arts, athletics, academics, etc. so that they will actually be able to produce outcomes, such as medals won at athletic conferences, an art portfolio, musical performances, coding projects, etc. Boarding schools highly value students who are committed to developing their craft. </span></p> <p style=\"margin-left: 6rem;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\"><b>3/ Apply to and attend a summer camp hosted by a reputable boarding school:</b> Most top boarding schools in the US host boarding summer camps lasting from 2-6 weeks, such as Andover, Exeter, Choate, Lawrenceville, etc. This is a great opportunity to get a taste of boarding school life: students will stay in the dorms, eat at dining halls, study with boarding school teachers and often, other future boarding school applicants.<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\">If you have any questions about the boarding school process, please don’t hesitate to contact us at (+84)24 3201 1841 (Vietnam), +66 2 105 3380 (Thailand) or send an email to contact@pointavenue.com.</span></p><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style=\"width: 50%;\" class=\"wp-image-2921 aligncenter\" src=\"https://paathena-public-prod.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Pve+2-06.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"246\" height=\"164\" /></div><b style='font-size:18px;margin-left: 2rem;margin-bottom:1rem'>6. What about the UK or Europe for school?</b><p style=\"margin-top: 2rem\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\">Everything I’ve mentioned so far is more specific to US boarding schools and you might be wondering about other countries as well. Every country is going to have their own application process and specifics, so I won’t get too deep into the weeds here.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\">However, the most important thing you should consider about what country you want to go to boarding school for is where do you want to build your network and probably pursue higher education?</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\">Attending a boarding school is more than just going to a good school, but it’s also about what community your family is joining and where you hope to end up afterwards. Previously I said that if you’re just looking for a better stepping stone to university, that’s not a good reason to attend. However, it is an important consideration.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\">So think about this–when you’re thinking about what school to attend, what universities do the students end up at? These are called matriculations and every boarding school will publish them. As you can probably imagine, if you attend a US boarding school, most students will matriculate into US universities. If you attend a boarding school in Europe, they usually end up at European universities with some students attending US universities.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\">This is important because of the curriculum they attend, the philosophies of education between countries, and the emphasis each culture and school places on different parts of student development. Another important factor is that if a boarding school isn’t consistently sending students to the kinds of universities that you hope your child will eventually attend, they will have a more difficult time getting there.</span></p><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style=\"width: 50%;\" class=\"wp-image-2921 aligncenter\" src=\"https://paathena-public-prod.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Pve+2-06.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"246\" height=\"164\" /></div><b style=\"font-size: 18px\">Here are some questions you should consider with your child to determine if boarding school abroad is really right for them.</b><ul style=\"margin: 2rem\"><li style=\"font-size: 16px\">Is your current school still challenging for your child?</li><li style=\"font-size: 16px\">Are there still extracurricular opportunities in your school or community that your child hasn’t taken advantage of and wants to?</li><li style=\"font-size: 16px\">Does your child want to challenge themselves in an unfamiliar, and most likely more difficult academic curriculum? Do you think they can truly handle it?</li><li style=\"font-size: 16px\">Is it better to remain in a familiar environment and community where they can do more innovative things or to join a foreign community as a stranger?

Another important factor is that if a boarding school isn’t consistently sending students to the kinds of universities that you hope your child will eventually attend, they will have a more difficult time getting there.</span></p><ul style=\"margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 2rem\"><li style=\"font-size: 16px\">Are you ready to have your child leave you?</li></ul><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\">Kids grow up fast and the time you have with them is precious. While boarding school can be a fantastic opportunity, also consider that time away from you is most likely time that won’t come back very easily. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\">So, take the time to consider carefully as a family! Of course there’s lots more questions you could ask and we can answer about boarding schools, so if you have any more, shoot us a message and we’ll be more than happy to discuss your situation and what is right for you.</span></p>"

We know the test isn’t exactly fun to study for or take, but a good score can be a crucial part of your profile. But hey, the College Board also recognizes this is and is making an effort to make the test shorter and less stressful, so take advantage of that fact.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\">Consider that in the US, there are over 25,000 high schools and it’s impossible for universities to know the quality of all of them. Similarly for schools abroad, universities won’t always be aware of the differences and rigor in curriculum of a school in another country, especially if you’re in a public school. The SAT provides a common point of comparison for a student’s relative academic and scholastic abilities. And while colleges are putting less weight on a student’s test scores to emphasize other aspects of the profile (GPA, ECAs, and so on), if there are two candidates that are otherwise similar but one has a strong SAT and the other doesn’t, the one with the strong SAT is going to be seen more favorably.</span></p> <p><span style=\"margin-left: 4rem;font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\"> <table style=\"width: 100%;\"> <tbody> <tr> <td style=\"width: 100%;\"><span style=\"font-size: 18px; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;\"><img class=\"wp-image-2921 aligncenter\" src=\"https://paathena-public-prod.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/article11.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"246\" height=\"164\" /></span></td> </tr> </tbody> </table>  </span> </p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\">At the end of the day, the SAT is just one more aspect of your application that is important to think of what is the best strategy to present the strongest application.

	"contents" : "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\">In preparation for Point Avenue&#8217;s upcoming Winter Intensive, our test prep instructors thought it essential to revisit our understanding of this fundamental skill and its relationship to academic preparedness. This winter session, as part of a holistic, inquiry-based teaching methodology, our team will be reinforcing uncompromising academic focus with that of rational exploration. Our destination? The induction and cultivation of critical thinking. Our vehicle? Two workshops on how to accomplish this. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\">What exactly is meant when &#8216;critical thinking&#8217; is invoked as the root cause of or remedy for a student&#8217;s academic achievement or failure? An answer comes from an insightful sixth-grader at the Olympia School during a recent class discussion on a related topic. &#8220;Critical thinking means thinking deeper.&#8221; He isn&#8217;t wrong; essentially, that is what it is. However, a more precise definition is required if we are to examine the importance of thinking critically in correlation to mastering university placement tests such as the SAT and AP. </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <table style=\"width: 800px;\"> <tbody> <tr> <td style=\"width: 790px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 18px; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;\"><img class=\"wp-image-2921 aligncenter\" src=\"https://paathena-public-prod.s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/131656843_393353311929446_3349402453659320134_n.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"246\" height=\"164\" /></span></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\">In logic, the object of study is reasoning. Logical thinking is an activity that students engage in–when they make claims, back them up with reasons, or make inferences and draw conclusions about what follows from a set of statements. Like many activities, reasoning can be done well, or it can be done poorly. The goal of logic is to distinguish sound reasoning from flawed reasoning. Once a student has become proficient at this, they have laid the groundwork for a life of &#8220;deep thinking,&#8221; i.e., critical thinking.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\">Unquestionably, the value of such a process of thinking, especially in education, is evident. Still, how can critical thinking be induced across ELEM, MSHS, and particularly Test Prep programs? Apart from the consistent encouragement of diligence, productive study habits, and independent inquiry, critical thinking is a prerequisite to mastering standardized tests, whether that be language tests such as the IELTS or TOEFL, or concerning academic preparedness tests like the SSAT, ACT, SAT, and AP. </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=\"font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\"><img class=\"wp-image-2922 aligncenter\" src=\"https://paathena-public-prod.s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/131275248_383648242912942_7675429508135689914_n.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"479\" height=\"319\" /></span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\">The most logical question then is; how do teachers and parents cultivate critical thinking in students? How do we instill such an analytical reasoning discipline in students who are deficient and develop it in students who already possess it? </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\">First, we must provide students with the basics. A solid foundation in proper test understanding must be laid brick by brick or, more precisely, concept by concept by the instructor in tandem with the student. Second, we must continually promote an intellectual environment that encourages independent exploration and practice, creative inquiry, and rigorous repetition. </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\">What do we mean by an intellectual environment? Where does thinking happen? That may sound like a silly question. Thinking, obviously, happens in our minds. But students do more than just think. They also share those thoughts. Opinions do not remain confined within our heads: we also express ourselves in our words and behavior. The ideas described and traded around in these ways and in these places, especially the more prevalent ideas, constitute the intellectual environment that we exist in. At Point Avenue, the environment our mentors strive to nurture and advocate for our students is paramount since it will impact how they view the world around them and fundamentally themselves.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=\"font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\"><img class=\"wp-image-2918 aligncenter\" src=\"https://paathena-public-prod.s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/131427216_821860685275909_6084706592186392872_n.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"475\" height=\"317\" /></span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\">That leads us to another question; what exactly is a worldview? How are we guiding our students in building a dynamic, bold, and resilient one? A worldview is the sum of related answers to the most critical questions in life. Thus our worldview is intimately tied to our sense of who we are, how we want to live, and how we see our place in the world. Actively reinforcing our opinion of ourselves is essential since that sense of self will dictate how we respond to obstacles, whether academic or not.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\">That leads us to critical thinking itself. Usually, logic and critical thinking skills are invoked in response to a need. And often, this need takes the form of a problem which can&#8217;t be solved until we gather information. Sometimes the problem is a practical one. &#8220;How do I spend my PA bucks?&#8221; In an academic environment, however, these problems are, of course, more distinct. &#8220;What did Timothy Matlack actually mean when he wrote The Declaration of Independence?&#8221; How do we guide our students in answering such questions on a standardized test? By helping them ask the right questions in return. </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\">Perhaps more than problems do, good questions get the mind thinking. Questions express doubts, identify predicaments, call for solutions, and demand answers. Indeed we might not fully understand the nature of a given problem until we have asked a decent question about it. And here is where the symbiosis between teacher and students truly begins. To succeed and progress, students need to know their weaknesses and be unafraid to share that. Only then can we as teachers hone in on correcting gaps in students&#8217; reasoning process. How do we do this? We mentor our students in establishing good habits and, more importantly, avoiding detrimental habits such as intellectual laziness, saving face, peer pressure, etc. Instead, we encourage curiosity, courage, patience, and precision. </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=\"font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2926\" src=\"https://paathena-public-prod.s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/team.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"391\" height=\"242\" /></span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=\"font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This winter, our instructors will focus on such techniques of rational inference and analytical judgme</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">nt.

Throughout her high school years, she studied at Triam Udom Suksa School in Bangkok, Thailand. During the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, she still continued to attend the online SAT preparation classes with Mr. John Sohn from Point Avenue. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before studying with Point Avenue, Ploy took the SAT test several times and her maximum score was around 1400. She thought that she could never surpass the 1500 mark.

		"contents" : "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">Our fast paced world requires people to constantly adapt and innovate. In 2020 alone, the world witnessed complex issues ranging from mitigating air pollution in cities to effective health responses to a global pandemic. Creativity, one of the 21st Century learning skills, is essential to nurture among children in order to better prepare them for the social and economical challenges of the future. Thus, creativity has the ability to help in future success (i.e. college and workplace readiness). Creativity has been valued throughout history, education, and culture. However, modern concepts and misinterpretations (myths) of teaching and enhancing creativity are still fairly new to parents, educators, and students. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">Dr. Myles Lynch, Ph.D. in Education from the University of New Hampshire, hosted a seminar on “Understanding and Nurturing Your Child’s Creativity” during the Point Avenue’s Mid-Autumn events. Dr. Lynch is passionate about supporting parents and educators who want to foster their children's creative skills. During the seminar, parents learned how to cultivate their child's creativity through a series of creative activities and suggestions. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">Creativity is a way of thinking differently, sometimes referred to as “thinking outside of the box”. Creativity varies from “Big C” or dealing with major world issues (i.e. pollution and poverty) to “Little C” in daily activities (i.e.navigating traffic, making meals, etc.). Interestingly, creativity is not age specific and it spans beyond purely arts and aesthetics and has more broad application towards fields such as math, science, and technology. Therefore, creativity is an ongoing process that involves more than purely risk-taking and individual work. Dr. Lynch explained that creativity is important because it promotes self-expression, critical thinking, problem solving, and at the same time reduces stress and boosts your mental health.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">Well-known techniques to be more creative included: brainstorming, frequent exercise, divergent thinking and the Wallas model were discussed. Additionally, Dr. Lynch summarized the following methods to nourish your children’s ingenuity in accordance with six elements of creativity: Risk/Courage, Play, Exploration, Collaboration, Perseverance and Social Context.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 21px;\"><b>  1. Create a Space and Environment for Creativity</b></span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">Creativity is enhanced when a child is encouraged to think differently and let go of complete certainty. Children should be given the freedom to be divergent in their thoughts and parents should provide a safe environment to be different and experiment.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">Children’s screen time affects their creativity and is an aspect parents should consider. By limiting the amount of time spent using phones and watching TV, parents can make room for their children’s creative activities such as rehearsing a play, learning to draw, reading books, and creative self-expression. </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=\"font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2559\" src=\"https://paathena-public-prod.s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/cre.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"290\" /><b></b></span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=\"font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 21px;\"><b>2.The Value of Play</b></span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">Parents and schools place a clear value and emphasis on learning in the form of getting good grades. However, unstructured play is an indispensable part of the development process. Parents are recommended to set up structured times and opportunities for unstructured, child-directed and imaginative play. In other words, when children are allowed to play freely, unencumbered by adults, they tend to be more creative and imaginative. </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=\"font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 21px;\"><b>3. Explore and Fail Without Being Judged</b></span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">As it takes courage to be creative and to fail, children should be encouraged by their parents and teachers to explore without being afraid of judgement and failure. An ideal environment for the development of creativity is when parents do not punish kids for providing an unexpected and potentially incorrect answer. Instead, parents should make sure their children feel comfortable experimenting and failing. In a creative environment, mistakes and failures are welcome as a part of the process and ‘weird’ or ‘strange’ answers should be encouraged.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">Furthermore, as much as creativity is against punishment, parents should also not reward their children for being creative. Rewards for creative behavior create incentives that are actually interfering with intrinsic motivation to create and may not be placing emphasis on being creative for its own sake. </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=\"font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2561\" src=\"https://paathena-public-prod.s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" /><b></b></span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=\"font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 21px;\"><b>4. Ask, Share and Collaborate</b></span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">Children should be given the opportunity to express and explain their creativity to different people. To enhance and encourage the creative process, parents need to ask and listen to what their child has to say with no judgement. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">Asking the right questions is very important, because not only does this help better understand their child’s thinking process, it also boosts their critical thinking and communication skills. Therefore, rather than focusing on the achievement, parents and educators should ask questions that emphasize the creative process and instill the habit of self-reflection on children such as “What did you like the most about this activity?” or “Did you have fun?”. Always focusing on the result of creativity takes away from the process of being creative in the first place. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adults as mentors should also integrate real-life issues and provide children with a chance to work with others and present their work to others. Creativity requires a level of social context and meaning outside of purely the classroom. Linking creative work to real world situations helps with intrinsic mot</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ivation.</span></span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <div id=\"attachment_2562\" style=\"width: 476px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-2562 size-full\" src=\"https://paathena-public-prod.s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Picture2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"466\" height=\"512\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span style=\"font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\"><em>                             Torrance Test for Creative Thinking</em></span></p></div> <p><span style=\"font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\"><b>In conclusion, </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fostering creativity for yourself and your children is no different from practicing a skill, planting a tree, or forming a healthy routine. Creativity takes the right mindset and a process of day-by-day work to master and refine. Therefore, creativity does not ‘just happen’ (like turning on a light switch) but rather takes years of work and progress to develop effectively. Dr. Lynch suggested that the earlier you start nurturing creativity for your child the better they will be prepared for the future demands of society. Adults have the opportunity to provide a creative environment for their child to help nurture the seed of innovation inside each person. Creativity must be allowed to grow using sufficient practice and an allowance for freedom.</span></span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\"><b>REFERENCES</b></span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">Dewett, T.

Unable to look after their students at all hours of the day, parents must trust and rely on their children to manage and complete their academic responsibilities without parental supervision.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;\">Last Sunday, 2 August, Danny Hwang, Founder &amp; CEO of Point Avenue, led a webinar on “Lessons Learned from West Point: Why Teaching Self-Discipline to Children Now Matters More than Ever&#8221;. An alumnus of the United States Military Academy at West Point-an institution known for having produced many leaders in the military, public, and business sectors-Danny shared lessons learned from his time at West Point and guided parents on how to form discipline and healthy habits in children for lifelong success.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From Danny, parents must teach the value and practice of discipline at a young age. Specific to this, Danny advised focusing on three core pillars: 1) </span><b>learning the value of hard work</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, 2) </span><b>building healthy habits</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and 3) </span><b>investing for the future</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. It goes without saying that children first look to their parents to understand what’s important and what to emulate. Parents must use this teaching opportunity and platform to share their values and beliefs.</span></span></p> <p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2396\" src=\"https://paathena-public-prod.s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pa2-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"616\" height=\"410\" /></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=\"font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;\"><b>1.Learning the Value of Hard Work</b></span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;\">As a child, Danny mowed the lawn as part of his house chores, often to the point where his hands blistered and bled. One time, Danny recalls asking his father if he could stop and rest his hands. To this, his father responded, “Put on gloves, and work until you’re done.” Danny’s parents used regular house chores to instill in their son two important life lessons. First, we must diligently work to grow and take care of all aspects of our life-whether this is mowing the lawn and studying for school exams or spending time with loved ones. It’s important that we spend time nurturing and building on what we have. Second, we must work to completion. That is, given a task and having developed a plan, we need to work to the best of our abilities to see that plan through. This is not saying that individuals shouldn’t take rest breaks or pivot when their plan fails. Danny’s parents wanted their son to understand the value of grit and not quitting. Nothing worth having comes easy.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=\"font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;\"><b>2.Building Healthy Habits</b></span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;\">If hard work is a prerequisite for success, developing and maintaining healthy habits focused on academic preparedness, extracurricular exploration, and personal growth will enable an individual to more quickly reach their goals. It is discipline that takes a single act of hard work and turns it into a healthy habit. Discipline is a choice… our choice. It is a decision. Better yet, all of our decisions. From an early age, Danny’s parents helped him make the right decisions and form healthy habits-habits which he maintains to this day. Simple habits such as completing homework immediately after school, working out individually after sports practice, washing dishes after dinner, and taking out the trash before settling in helped Danny develop the will and discipline to survive the grind at West Point and thrive in a relentless environment. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;\">More importantly, adopting these healthy habits enabled Danny to more quickly take control of his life and helped him navigate the many challenges that would come. The philosopher Aristotle once said, “We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, therefore, is not an act, but a habit.” With healthy habits firmly ingrained, Danny went on to achieve top scores at West Point, in addition to serving on the school’s student government and competitive skydiving team. </span></p> <p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2395\" src=\"https://paathena-public-prod.s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pa1-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"598\" height=\"398\" /><b></b></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=\"font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;\"><b>3.Investing in the future</b></span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;\">We generally all want the best things in life. More importantly, we want them now. It is important that parents help their students learn the value of patience and making decisions that forego short term gratification for long term rewards. Success is the sum of small efforts, repeated day-in and day-out. When Danny's father promised him, \"I’ll give you a penny for every page you read,&#8221; he did not intend for Danny to read for money. Instead, Danny’s father used this motivation to incentivize Danny to improve his reading comprehension, develop a deep reading habit, and explore a world of knowledge that would aid him in the future. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;\">As parents, we need to help our students invest in their future and focusing their current efforts on: academic preparedness, extracurricular exploration, and personal growth.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;\"><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Academic Preparedness</span>:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Parents must ensure that their students commit time to building foundational knowledge across all academic subjects, such as Math, Science, Language and Literature, and Social Science. We don’t need to force our children to be the best in every subject; however, they need to acquire basic knowledge to learn how to think critically and problem-solve. More effectively, parents must help their students identify their academic strengths and interests. Having identified both, we must encourage and support our children to take on more advanced and challenging courses related to those interests.</span></span></p> <p><span style=\"font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><b>Extracurricular Exploration</b></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Parents must encourage and support their children to become leaders in their areas of interest. It’s important to encourage children to explore their interests by joining communities of like-minded people, such as school clubs, service organizations, sports teams, and academic competitions. It’s natural for students to sift in and out of different activities and communities as they are exploring. As parents, it’s important to support our children’s decisions; at the same time, we must teach our students about commitment and giving something an honest try. Upon joining an activity, it’s imperative that children remain committed to it for at least one year. This is the minimum time required to explore an activity and develop an informed opinion-on top of learning different roles and responsibilities.</span></span></p> <p><span style=\"font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;\"><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Personal Growth</span>:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Parents must encourage and support their students to research, read about, and seek advice from experts in their children’s areas of interest. It’s important that we empower our students to take charge of their own learning by teaching them to be deliberate in how they grow their knowledge, skills, and experiences. Within their children’s communities, parents must encourage-sometimes challenge-their students to take up greater roles and responsibilities. In turn, this will help their children acquire new knowledge and skills, preparing them for future challenges and opportunities. Simultaneously, parents must open new doors for their students by helping them discover new opportunities outside of their communities to further aid their children’s personal growth. Overtime, and all together, these investments will help shape our students to become leaders in their areas of interest.</span></span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=\"font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;\"><b><i><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Conclusion</span>:</i></b></span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;\">With the pandemic resurging, and the high likelihood of returning to online learning, parents must help their students develop and maintain academic and personal discipline by establishing support systems. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;\">We can’t expect our children to cope with this new learning environment and thrive without showing them what right looks like and how to succeed. It’s imperative that parents use the new academic year to explore different systems and processes to better support their students’ learning. To this end, setting clear expectations and reinforcing healthy habits are key. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;\">Throughout our Summer Term, Danny and his online-based students initiated their morning classes at 6:30 AM with a high-intensity interval training workout. Exercising causes the body to release endorphins, triggering a positive feeling. Working out early doesn’t just improve our fitness, it helps us mentally prepare for the remainder of the day. Another key tip Danny shared with parents is to try and align their work schedule with their student’s learning schedule. Both parents and students should work in chunks (dedicated time blocks) and take rest breaks together. Children are more inclined to work when working alongside their parents. Additionally, this allows for both parents and students to catch up and relax together during their breaks and meals.  </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;\">Lastly, Danny shared that parents must make time at the end of their day to recap their student’s learning and ensuing activities. It is not enough to allow teachers to teach and students to learn on their own. Parents must follow up with their children’s homework assignments, exam preparation, and overall learning progress. “Following up” doesn’t mean to simply ask students if they’ve completed their tasks. Rather, parents should use these opportunities to have the children teach what they recently learned (i.e. math concept, grammar rule, history lesson). This provides a check on learning and helps instill confidence.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;\">The word “discipline” is often associated with “punishment”. At Point Avenue, we don’t believe that punishment, or negative reinforcement, is the most effective way to educate children. Rather, we teach that discipline is a choice to do the right thing and to invest in greater long term rewards. As parents, we must help our children develop and maintain discipline so that they are prepared to meet current and future challenges.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parents are invited to follow the official Point Avenue Facebook page at: </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/PointAvenue\" target='_blank'><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://www.facebook.com/PointAvenue</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to get updates on our upcoming events.

To add to this stress, SAT has recently cancelled test dates, added new ones, and colleges and students are put in a hard spot about what the path forward looks like. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s impossible to tell what the future will hold, but refer to this guide to learn the latest about what is happening with the SAT and what you should do for your college prospects.</span></p> <p><b>Snapshot of SAT Updates</b></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of this writing:</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Canceled Tests</span></p> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">02 May 2020</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">06 June 2020</span></li> </ul> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anticipated Test Dates</span></p> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">29 August 2020: SAT 1</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">26 September 2020: SAT 1 only</span> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a new test tentatively added to address the concerns around the virus</span></li> </ul> </li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">03 October 2020: SAT 1 &amp; 2</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">05 December 2020: SAT 1 &amp; 2</span></li> </ul> <p><a href=\"https://pages.collegeboard.org/sat-covid-19-updates\" target='_blank'><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Review the latest news for the SAT here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Here are some key takeaways:</span></p> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> <blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Students can register for these administrations starting in May. We’ll contact students directly during the week of May 26 to provide an exact date. Eligible students can register with a fee waiver.”</span></p></blockquote> </li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Students can get early access to register for August, September, and October if they’re:</span> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Already registered for June</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the high school class of 2021 and don’t have SAT scores</span></li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /> </span></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If schools remain closed until the fall, </span><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-04-15/college-board-to-offer-sat-at-home-if-coronavirus-closures-continue\" target='_blank'><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">College Board is also considering moving tests online</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. However, the details of such a scenario have yet to be released.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Now that we’re caught up, what should you do?</b></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s easy and normal to fall into a state of panic and be paralyzed by an uncertain future. As always, however, don’t focus on what you can’t control, focus on what you can control. It’s important to remember that you’re not the only one being affected by this situation, and that hundreds of students and families just like you are in the same position. So what can you do?</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>#1. Hit the books for some extra practice</b></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For some, the test cancellations may be a blessing in disguise. Many of you may find that you have more free time than you did previously, and you should use that time to continue working on your SAT skills. Don’t take the test cancellations as a sign for you to kick your feet up and push off studying for a couple months! It’s your time to seize the opportunity, hit the books, and prepare yourself to get the best possible SAT score. </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember, that with tests being canceled and new test dates being back to back from one another, you have less time to prepare for the SAT between tests and fewer opportunities to take it if you aren’t happy with your initial score. Practice now and ensure that you earn a strong SAT score from the beginning!</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For those others who were ready to slay the canceled SAT tests, you’re probably disheartened. It’s tough, but that means you have to stay on top of your game. <em><strong>SAT skills are perishable like playing an instrument, and it’s imperative that you continue to practice to keep your game sharp. </strong></em></span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>#2. Get the TOEFL or IELTS out of the way</b></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re an international student, you will need an English language proficiency test to prove your English language abilities. With the SAT canceled, colleges are likely to place an emphasis on these tests to determine if an international candidate is prepared for higher education. </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike the SAT which is only offered once a month for select months throughout the year, TOEFL and IELTS tests are offered almost every weekend. While many test centers are also closed right now because of the virus, </span><a href=\"https://www.ets.org/s/cv/toefl/at-home/\" target='_blank'><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TOEFL is moving to an online test you can take at home.</span></a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re already crushing the SAT Reading &amp; Writing sections, you should have no problem acing the TOEFL or IELTS with a little practice around what the actual tests entail and learning what they’re looking for. If you are struggling with the SAT Reading &amp; Writing, then studying for the TOEFL or IELTS should help you with the SAT. </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While some colleges you have your eye on might have different policies around what qualifies to fulfill their English language requirements, to be on the safe side and keep your options open, <em><strong>you should have a strong TOEFL or IELTS score on record.</strong></em></span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>#3. Strengthen Your Extracurricular Profile</b></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the emphasis many Asians place on standardized tests like the SAT (my parents included), it’s only one part of your college application. Your GPA, extracurriculars, and letters of recommendation are all very important parts of your application. </span></p> <p><img src=\"https://paathena-public-prod.s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image1-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some things you can do:</span></p> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Raise or maintain a high GPA</span> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some schools are offering an option to switch from Pass / No Pass from the regular GPA. However, if you do so, do you have a good reason for it? Everyone is experiencing the coronavirus, but if you’re relatively well off, <em><strong>there’s no reason you shouldn’t be able to maintain a good GPA.</strong></em></span></li> </ul> </li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stay involved in your clubs and extracurricular activities</span> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your plans may have been quashed by the virus, but now is the time more than ever to realize the importance of working remotely. Just because you aren’t physically with your club mates doesn’t mean you can’t continue to find ways to be productive. <em><strong>Flex your creativity and leadership!</strong></em></span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some ideas:</span> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Organize an online fundraiser for those affected by the virus.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Continue meeting with your club through virtual meetings.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rally members to volunteer for a local service organization.</span></li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Talk to your teachers about letters of recommendation</span> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With classes online, you’re getting less physical facetime with your teachers. Colleges weigh letters of recommendation heavily when considering a candidate, so <em><strong>now is the time to prove that you’re engaged in class more than ever and step up to the plate.</strong></em></span></li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>#4. Research colleges and majors and work on other parts of your application</b></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes students forget the reason that they’re studying for the SAT in the first place! Use the time now to do research into the colleges and majors that you might be interested in. These colleges are potentially going to be where you spend the next 4 years of your life, so do the research! You wouldn’t buy something off Amazon without reading some reviews first, would you? College might be one of the most consequential purchases you make, so there’s no reason to not do your homework.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the same time, the college application has many parts: the personal statement, developing a resume, supplemental essays, and so on. <em><strong>Use this time now to get a head start instead of waiting for the last minute.</strong></em> Almost every student underestimates how long it will take them to write their essays and they find themselves in a mad cram session to finish everything. Don’t be a sucker! Get started early!</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Some colleges are waiving standardized testing requirements. Should I still take it?</b></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Short answer, yes. </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Colleges won’t penalize you for things out of your control. For example, if all the SAT tests are canceled except for one, colleges will know that and take it into consideration. Colleges, much like The College Board (don’t get the two confused), are monitoring the situation everyday, creating contingency plans, and determining the best path forward. Remember that you are not alone in this, and colleges will create the best solution they see fit for incoming applicants, whatever that means. </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With that said, you should take the SAT if you can. While some colleges are waiving the requirement,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> they will consider why you don’t have a test score.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If you don’t have a test score while another applicant with a similar profile to yours does, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">they’ll question why you don’t have a test score.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It’s entirely possible that you had a tragic circumstance that prevented you from taking the test, but you’ll need to sufficiently explain that. </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If everyone else is able to take the test that has similar circumstances to you, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">it’ll become a question why you don’t have a test score. </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of the day, colleges will still need an efficient way to separate good applicants from bad ones, and the SAT and other tests will be the quickest and easiest way for them to do that. That doesn’t mean you have no hope if you absolutely cannot take the test, but you should keep in mind your reasoning for not being able to take the test and the rest of your profile should be very strong. </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Conclusion</b></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Key takeaways:</span></p> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SAT is planning for tests in August, September, October, November, and December</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What you should do in the meantime:</span> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Continue studying for the SAT</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get the TOEFL or IELTS out of the way</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Strengthen other parts of your application profile</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Research colleges and majors and work on the rest of your application now</span></li> </ul> </li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You should still take the SAT if you can despite some colleges waiving the requirement</span></li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There will be a life after COVID-19 and there will be a return to normalcy. However, that new normal will probably be different from the previous normal. The only certain thing in life is that things will change. Will you be prepared to learn and adapt to succeed or will you continue to wish things were the way they once were? (The answer is that you should be ready to adapt :))</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">John Fujita, Deputy Head of Admission Consulting, Point Avenue </span></i></p>",

In fact, CEOs of Fortune 500 companies (Apple, Google, Facebook, etc.) have identified the 21st Century Skills of Creativity, Communication, Collaboration, Critical Thinking, Character, and Diligence as vital for the success of potential employees (See: <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/ellevate/2018/08/06/the-skills-you-need-to-succeed-in-2020/#efa6436288a0\" target='_blank'>The Skills You Need to Succeed in 2020</a>). At Point Avenue, we agree that these skills are essential for children to practice at an early age and our educational philosophy is to integrate lessons that combine academic rigor and 21st Century concepts.</p> <p>Similar to playing the piano, drawing artwork, or training to run a marathon, the 21st Century Skills take continued effort and practice to master. As a parent, you should take the perspective that 21st Century skills are attributes and not personality traits which can be practiced at home, in school, and other social situations. The following section describes each of the skills and explains strategies for home and additional resources.</p> <p><img src=\"https://paathena-public-prod.s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image2-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p> <p><strong>Creativity</strong></p> <ul> <li>Description: Creativity is best described as your intelligence having fun. As a result, you can have a Eureka moment in which you come up with a new idea or solution. Creativity supports imagination and the ability to think of new ideas. Creativity also supports the ability to be a free thinker and problem solver which are important skills for college and workplace readiness.</li> <li>At Home: A combination of free play and games can help support creativity. Games which help to support creativity include: pictionary, charades, drama, or acting.</li><li>Resource: <a style='cursor:pointer;' onclick='window.open(\"https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2020/04/coronavirus-tag-and-other-games-kids-play-during-a-pandemic/609253\")';>Free Play and Creativity.</a></li><li>Resource: <a href=\"https:www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG9CE55wbtY\" target='_blank'>Creativity in School TED Talk.</a></li></ul> <p><strong>Collaboration</strong></p> <ul> <li>Description: Demonstrate ability to work effectively and respectfully with diverse people and teams. Flexibility and willingness to be helpful in making compromises to accomplish a common goal. Everyone in your family should add value and each person is a piece of the puzzle making it whole.</li> <li>At Home: You should have your child help you with chores around the house. Chores have been shown to be effective in connecting purpose and community and knowing HOW to help. The key is for you to do the chores with the child (not just assigning chores). Make it a communal practice that has broader implications for family success.</li> <li>Resource: <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2018/06/09/616928895/how-to-get-your-kids-to-do-chores-without-resenting-it\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to Get Your Kids to Do Chores At Home (article)</a>.</li> </ul> <p><img src=\"https://paathena-public-prod.s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image1-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p> <p><strong>Critical Thinking</strong></p> <ul> <li>Description: The ability to reason effectively and use various types of methods to arrive at a solution (inductive and deductive). Make appropriate judgement and decision making (looking ahead and planning future outcomes).</li> <li>At Home: A great way to increase critical thinking is to incorporate strategy games at home including: scrabble, chess, monopoly, legos, and other online games (see resource).</li> <li>Resource: <a href=\"https:///www.commonsense.org/education/top-picks/games-for-building-critical-thinking-skills\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Online Games That Help Critical Thinking.</a></li> </ul> <p><strong>Communication</strong></p> <ul> <li>Description: Articulate thoughts and ideas effectively using verbal (oral/speech) and nonverbal (posture/tone) communication skills . For example: face to face, using technology, written form, public speaking, etc.</li> <li>At Home: Each day you should have a set time where you have a discussion topic with your family. A few example questions are: What is the best invention in the world? What makes a person good? If you could eat dinner with one person who would it be and why?</li> <li>Resource: Discussion Topics you can have with your child.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Character</strong></p> <ul> <li>Description: The mental and moral qualities distinctive to an individual. Good character means that you do the right thing especially when no one else is looking. People with good character often have traits like integrity, honesty, courage, loyalty, fortitude, and other important virtues that promote good behavior.</li> <li>At Home: One of the most important aspects of character development is to model good behavior at home. Parents should work with their children to talk about leadership and mentor them during these unpredictable times. The more time you spend with your child the more they will view you as a stable character in their lives they can trust and emulate in the future.</li> <li>Resource: TED talk on teaching character: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxHGSTV3LF0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TED Talk</a>.</li> </ul> <p><img src=\" https://paathena-public-prod.s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/80455510_1453832041434696_2951544484074094592_o.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p> <p><strong>Diligence</strong></p> <ul> <li>Description: The skill of having or showing care and conscientiousness in one's work or duties. In other words, tirelessly persevering and doing things with care, attention to detail, and effort. Not giving up easily on something that is difficult.</li> <li>At Home: Your child should focus on the depth (not breadth) of a topic which interests them in order to practice diligence, perseverance, and grit. Encourage your child to present a research topic to the rest of the family and have one new topic every other week (Example topics: pollution, COVID-19, uniforms in school, world hunger, etc).</li> <li>Resource: Character Lab and the concept of perseverance, diligence, and grit:<a href=\"https://characterlab.org/playbooks/grit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Character Lab</a></li> </ul> <p>Written by<br/> <em>Myles L.

While picking up trash in the hot sun, we also had an opportunity to have conversations and bond outside of our PA offices. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We had a great time as sanitation warriors and we look forward to doing more good for our city! 👏</span></p> <p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2360\" src=\"https://paathena-public-prod.s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/KHC-x-PA-4__0.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" /></p> <p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2359\" src=\"https://paathena-public-prod.s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/KHC-x-PA-3__0.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" /></p> <p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2361\" src=\"https://paathena-public-prod.s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Keep-Hanoi-Clean-x-PA-1_.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1478\" height=\"1108\" /></p>"

Jason was not only a good writing coach, but also an amazing listener. I was astonished by how all his advice and guidance, based on my many essay drafts, were able to connect all my ideas, life events, thoughts, and beliefs and weave them into one narrative so fluidly. It brought order and clarity to what felt like pure chaos.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;\">Admittedly, I also developed a clearer understanding of myself throughout my time working with him. My growth and his trait of being a good listener, made a real and significant change to my whole application as he helped me figure out how to showcase my best authentic self. Working with him really made me feel all my efforts led to a perfect and positive result. I hope there will be future opportunities to work with Jason again because he not only helped me complete everything with the highest quality possible, but he also helped me learn about myself throughout the process. I would recommend Jason to anyone.</span></p>"

In the small TOONG office, I was scared of a gloomy future that required an overwhelming level of preparation. I also may or may not have gotten scared by a loud Mr. Tommy who shouted out of dedication and passion. But I came back because I was assured that PA was different and that the mentors had faith in me.</span></span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;\">Indeed, PA is so different that I could spend days talking about everything here.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;\">Just like cream puffs, you are incredibly sweet. Anytime I come to the office, I always feel welcome. Many adults tell us kids that “they have been there, in our shoes”. But I realized that “being there” doesn’t consist only of giving us a checklist to prepare, but really “being there” to understand our hopes and fears. You are always there for me even when I can do things by myself, simply to cheer me up and help me believe in myself more. No matter how busy you are, you are always smiling or working out in the gym, making you a great source of motivation and encouragement. You make it so easy for me to venture into new territory with the courage to fail, because I know you’ll always be there to pick me up and guide me through those failures. You never said it explicitly, but by observing the way you treat students and parents, I have learned how you instill “Character First” in your education: by embracing it yourselves.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;\">One thing that I love and admire so much about Point Ave is the fact that everything is raw and real. You gave us everything you had, and you trusted us with everything you gave us.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;\">PA is where I have learned the true definition of leadership. You are all busy but always willing to spend time with us. You taught me that great leadership isn’t based on a top-down system, but on collaboration and understanding.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;\">PA is where I have learned to embrace differences and respect my own choices. Most people just see the tip of the iceberg. I was urged by PA mentors to look at matters from different perspectives, and I think I really have become a more accepting person, to other people and to myself. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;\">PA is where learning never stops. I learned that choosing a major in university doesn’t mean I have no other choices, and growing up to be an adult doesn’t mean I will have all the answers.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;\">PA is where the sun always shines, where everyone is smiling and hugging students, at the reception desk, the teacher’s room, and especially in the gym.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;\">So yeah! Point Avenue is not an English center, and Point Avenue’s mentors are definitely not like most adults.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;\">You never have to sugarcoat your profiles or students’ achievements. You are whoever we need you to be, and I can never thank you enough for that. I mean… cream puffs contain only butter, water, flour and eggs, yet they are the best dessert!</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To an infinite number of cream puffs between PA and Y., and beyond</span>:</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1034\" src=\"https://paathena-public-prod.s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Thu-Yen.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" /></span></p>"

He actually sacrificed a lot of things for us, booking flights and cars to Yale to encourage and support us, time and energy, patience in waiting for us to persuade our school teachers in allowing him to go and support us. He designed and plan our techniques to fight in the WSC senior division clearly and effectively. He taught us to follow plans step by step. That extra effort makes Point Avenue mentors different from others.&#8221; - <strong>Tran Bang Linh</strong></span></p>"
