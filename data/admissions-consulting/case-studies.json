      "Point Avenue mentors taught me so much about prioritization and managing my workload. When application season came, I felt prepared and knew exactly what I needed to do next, so I didn't feel overwhelmed by the large workload. It was a great journey, staying up past 11pm, past midnights and past much sorrow for weeks on. I definitely have many regrets, but everything is left behind now since we have reached our goal, and I DEFINITELY could not have done it without the help of everybody at PA, thank you once again!<br><br>Thank you to all of my AC and test prep mentors at PA, for putting up with all of my shenanigans for 3 years and staying with me until the end during the application. Your kind words and encouragement helped me got through everything. <br><br>GO BLUE JAYS!!!"

I had a lot of self-doubt, especially being surrounded by so many talented peers. My success this year was only possible because of PA, and I cannot express how much I appreciate all my mentors. Not only did my mentors went through every step of the application with me, from refining my essays to preparing me for interviews, they also introduced me to so many cool opportunities and experts. Applying to colleges is so stressful and emotionally draining, but I also learned a lot about myself and the life I want to have."

I came to them with a jumbled collection of stories and left with polished essays that fully illustrated my key qualities. With their help, I was able to organize my thoughts, develop my narrative capabilities, and improve my overall writing.<br><br>Despite starting my essays extremely late, they still gave me relevant books to read and evaluate along the way, enhancing my understanding of truly impactful writing. They taught me to start out by compiling my full story (even if it was way over the word limit!). Then, through many drafts, I learned how to edit my writing down to a concise essay that still portrayed the full essence of the original story. I can say without a doubt that my writing has progressed throughout the whole process!<br><br>On top of meticulously analyzing countless drafts, my mentors prepared me for alumni interviews. Through many practice interviews, they gave me advice on how to answer questions eloquently, taught me the basics of “Charming 101”, and helped me build up the needed confidence for a successful interview. After all the hard work, I will be attending Princeton University this fall. In the end, I left Point Avenue with refined writing, speaking, and analytical skills that will come in handy in the future!!"

      "I started working with Point Avenue to prepare for my college application at the beginning of grade 11. Before coming to PA, I had actually visited a few consultancies, but I didn't really feel like I was heard. They told me to read books I had no interest in, and apply to schools more for the prestige than substance. After one meeting with PA, where all my interests and goals were laid out and considered, I knew this was the place for me.<br><br>During my two years with PA, I was pushed in every aspect possible, from academics, testing, to interests and extracurricular activites. Despite the constant push, I always felt comfortable, because all my mentors were really like brothers and sisters. They were willing to listen to my complains and crazy business ideas, and respond to my text messages at 11pm. During stressful times, I think you need someone who is ready and willing to go through the endless pile of tasks and problems with you. New students should expect to learn unexpected things about themselves and be pushed out of your comfort zone to work hard for your goals."

They make it so easy for me to venture into new territory with the courage to fail, because I know they'll always be there to pick me up and guide me through those failures. From watching the teachers and mentors interact with students and parents, I have learned how they instill “Character First” in education: by embracing it themselves. PA is where I have learned to embrace differences and respect my own choices. Most people just see the tip of the iceberg. I was urged by PA mentors to look at matters from different perspectives, and I think I really have become a more accepting person, to other people and to myself."

When I planned ideas alone, I dwelled on ideas wondering if this was a good topic to write about or not.

As a result, I was able to write essays that encapsulated myself well and I am not only satisfied with my college results, but the essays as well.

They introduced me to a new way to organize my work and time: planner. Overall, my work ethics improved a lot after PA because everyone here is extremely efficient and taught me a lot about time management.

      "When I decided to apply to universities in the United States, I wasn’t planning on seeking help from any outside sources because I was unable to find a counseling agency that suited me and my needs. Then I got the chance to attend one of PA’s workshops about personal statement writing, and at that time my personal statement was not good at all. The teachers were very patient with my writing and guided me toward a final piece that truly represented me. Countless questions were raised to provoke my mind and to allow me to define my identity. The mentors did so much more than just revising our essay or aiding us with the application, they truly helped us to reach further, dream bigger, and better ourselves each and everyday. Looking back, I believe that going to PA’s workshop about crafting personal statements and later on, joining the Point Avenue family was one of the best decisions my senior year."

It was only thanks to Jason’s and Tommy’s encyclopaedic understanding of the US admissions system and indefatigable support and guidance that I was able to complete my applications at all, let alone obtain an offer from the school of my dreams.

They understood my predicament, stayed up late well past midnight to help me with my essays, and moved forward even when training meant I was vanishing for hours at a time. They did not make any effort to “teach” me or force me to write as someone I was not, but rather listened patiently to what ideas I had and guided my thinking to tease out the best possible version of myself. Tommy and Jason are two of the most dedicated, competent, and passionate educators I’ve had the honour of learning from, and I would definitely encourage anyone else in need of help to seek guidance from them as well."

      "Before starting PA, I had tried two different places for college advising. Both of those resources didn't have half as much as what PA had to offer with their spreadsheets. They also lacked the emotional support/human connection that PA advisors definitely have. Without you guys, I would have been 1000000x more stressed than I was, which is unimaginable because I was already pretty stressed. You guys were very supportive and confident in my abilities which helped me believe in myself more. The whole team were always so kind and helpful. I never hesitated if I needed to ask them for help.<br><br>I so appreciate the spreadsheets/organizational documents. They were very useful in keeping me on track and having a place I can go back and reference if needed. Through this process, I was also learning how to write. Sounds kind of silly, but you guys didn't only teach me how to apply to college, but also how to write about myself in a honest but also interesting way. My counselor has a background in creative writing and I was applying to art/design school, so he gets where I'm coming from and was thus very helpful with my artist statements/blurbs for art pieces. I honestly don't think I would have been alive right now if it wasn't for him. He helped keep me on track and provided quick and honest feedback on my essays. Being a creative himself, he also really understood where I was coming from with my artwork and artist statements. They also showed me what a good portfolio looks like, which helped me immensely when assembling mine."

I met Mr. Danny, Mr. Tommy and Mr. Tin for the first time there, not knowing they would become lifetime mentors, who are always ready to give me advice and encouragement. After camp, I remembered watching then-seniors fighting back their fatigue to study Mr. Danny's list of SSAT vocab words, and write their 50th essay. \"Lucky I'm not one of them,\" I thought to myself.<br><br>This time last year, I started thinking about where I would be in the future. US? UK? High school? College? My brain was tangled and couldn't decided. Thankfully, Mr. Tommy met with my family and me and gave us guidance and I started the application process in the summer. I want to thank Mr. Francoa and Mr. Charles for teaching me IELTS and SSAT, and giving me so much work to do on Sundays, when most people spend time with their families. Chi Giang helped me with every essay, every interview practice, and even bought me bananas and dumplings to fuel our essay-writing sessions. Months flew by and it was already time to submit my applications. Chi Anh Thu was there watching me submitting every little thing. I have such vivid memories researching every single school with her, it was crazy to think the application process was almost over. Then on March 10, we videochatted and screamed when I received the acceptance letter to Webb.<br><br>I cannot believe how fast the years have flown by. I'm so thankful for my PA family!"

To this end, PA tracked and followed up major deadlines for submitting documents, as well as introducing me to amazing scholarship opportunities. Thanks to the huge boost from PA, I’ve been fortunate to have all the US unis meet my family’s financial needs.<br><br>As an applicant for both US and UK schools, I sought guidance from PA’s team with expertise in both countries’ systems. For US unis, PA helped me express myself in essays through intense summer writing seminars and in my ECA profile that demonstrated a clear interest in economics, as opposed to my previous approach of just taking on whichever opportunities that became available. PA’s test prep team worked in unison with AC to help me build an overall competitive application.<br><br>Writing the personal statement for UK unis required that I display intellectual curiosity by exploring specific topics in economics from wider reading. After recognising my struggle to write deeply about economics, PA connected me with an older student who had been admitted to Cambridge. I had discussions at length with them about news, articles, and books that made their way onto my statement. They helped me grow out of pass-the-next-test mentality and be more comfortable in interviews. Moreover, that this mentor is a uni student who once needed PA’s help. This fact spoke volumes to me on PA’s continued interest in students even after they left the nest and how much the students have grown from position of receiving help to giving one through PA.<br><br>As I finish highschool and get ready for uni, I think I can say the same for my relationship with PA. Though I began taking AC service to boost my chances to a good uni in return, I can say now with certainty that my PA experience was more than just transactional. My past years with PA have been transformational--from a clueless student to driven learner, coming-of-age movie protagonist with even greater challenges ahead--and I would not have it spent any other way."
