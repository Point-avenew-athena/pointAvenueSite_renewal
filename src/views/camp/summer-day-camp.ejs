									<p class="talk">I'm impressed by how Point Avenue's mentors create so many exciting activities and give students so many opportunities to learn interesting topics. My children were very shy about being in public at first, but then became a lot more confident and mature thanks to the help of Point Avenue's dedicated mentors, who always treat their students like a family.</p>

									<p class="talk">“At Point Avenue, teachers always contact parents regularly to keep them up-to-date on children’s progress. They also organize a midterm private meeting for each parent so that we can catch up with our children’s study, strengths and weaknesses to improve and better their performance. Nhat Minh participates in class very enthusiastically and has been able to speak for a lot longer during his debate speeches. Hyewon and Travis are his debate coaches and he likes them both very much.”</p>

										Debate Program student</p>
									<p class="talk">Debate is, in many ways, very life-changing from my experience. I learned to be more critical, analytical, and most importantly, to be a listener. Many people
										perceive Debate as a highly competitive activity, but Debate itself is a life skill. Learning Debate at PA is an exceptional experience. Ms. Hyewon is not like any debate teachers I have met - she is incredibly encouraging and loving. At first, I didn't feel confident coming to class, but eventually, everyone got on just fine. I was
										impressed by the way Ms. Hyewon treats each student as if they were her children and how teachers and staff here are selfless for their students.
										At Point Avenue, I didn't just learn to be a Debater. I also became a better person thanks to the guidance from the teachers here.</p>

									<p class="talk">“During my 4 IELTS cram sessions at Point Avenue, I received enormous support and encouragement from the mentors, especially Sarah and Francoa. In addition to a 2.5-hour class, they always spent extra time tutoring me and providing meticulous feedback, especially for my Writing skills. Since the Test Prep mentors are subject matter experts, teachers can give individual care and detailed comments on strengths, weaknesses and areas of improvement for each student.”</p>
