Go ahead and toss salt over your shoulder, light incense, and rub your hands together praying to get off the waitlist.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or you could write a Letter of Continued Interest (LOCI)&#8211;your best shot at turning the tide.</span></p> <p><b>What is a LOCI?</b></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A LOCI (we pronounce it ‘Loki’ like the trickster god) is a letter that states your commitment to the school, updates them about your life since you’ve submitted your application, and explains why you and the school are the perfect fit for each other.</span></p> <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3586" src="https://www.pointavenue.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-359.png" alt="" width="800" height="538" srcset="https://www.pointavenue.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-359.png 800w, https://www.pointavenue.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-359-300x202.png 300w, https://www.pointavenue.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-359-768x516.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you fire up the old spelling machine, double check if then what your school’s deferral or waitlist process is. Not every school will allow or want a letter sent to them. Some may only require that you hit ‘Yes’ on a form in your application portal while others may not give any instructions at all. Always double check.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a school doesn’t give any specific instructions, you should always send a LOCI to confirm your commitment to a school. While chances are slim that you get off the waitlist, this letter can be the difference between acceptance and rejection. </span></p> <p><b>Guide to Your LOCI</b></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This guide is meant to give you a solid structure that works, but remember that real people read these letters. These people argue why you should come off the waitlist over another candidate. So get creative, make people laugh, cry, and reflect with you.</span></p> <hr /> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td style="width: 853.056px;"><span style="font-size: 16px;"><b>PA Points:</b></span></p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Length: 1 to 1.5 pages max</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ID: Include your name and any ID numbers, such as your Common App or School ID, in the header.

Eyes still searching for focus:</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We regret to inform you…However, we offer you a spot on the waitlist…”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are fewer crushing feelings than starting a new day with the news that you’ve been waitlisted to yet another school. Patrick (a pseudonym) felt this pain on a chilly morning in 2020 after being rejected or waitlisted from almost all of his schools. Things looked grim, and we advised Patrick to write </span><b>letters of continued interest (LOCI)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to all of his waitlisted schools. To write was the last thing on Patrick’s mind, but to wait and do nothing while he could still do something was absolutely the wrong move. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patrick gathered up his remaining willpower to write a letter outlining how he has grown since submitting his application and why he believes the University of Chicago should be his future home. The day after Patrick sent the letter, an admissions officer from Chicago called him and offered a spot in the freshman class if he was willing to commit to Chicago right then and there. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patrick took the offer.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s take a look at Patrick’s letter. </span></p> <p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note: specific names have been edited for anonymity.</span></i></p> <p><b>Analysis</b></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dear University of Chicago Admissions,</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I sincerely hope that you and your families are safe and well. I was disappointed to have been placed on the waitlist; however, my commitment to The University of Chicago remains steadfast. If I am accepted, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I will submit my deposit, hang up my UChicago pennant, and plan my trip to Chicago for move-in day immediately</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Please allow me to reiterate my interest in The University of Chicago and share one final update here. </span></p> <hr /> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td><b><i>Introduction: </i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clearly and creatively stating his commitment to UChicago.</span></i></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <hr /> <p>Like many students, my senior year has been defined by the Covid-19 pandemic. While I’m disappointed that my graduation has been canceled and that I will not be able to spend the remainder of my senior year with my peers, this global crisis has driven me to grow both as a student and as a citizen. Local college closures left me as the sole intern in the district office of Congressman Clay Davis where I fielded calls from frightened constituents. The duties of an intern are often viewed as busy-work. However, I was able to alleviate fears and inspire hope by providing people with locations for Covid-19 testing sites, explaining why the government is promoting social distancing, and simply reminding them that there are people working hard everyday to ensure their safety and the safety of their loved ones. Since our office closed, I started volunteering at our local food shelter to help protect the most at-risk members of my community from having to put their lives on the line to get basic necessities. My experience serving my community during these extraordinary times has cemented my resolve to be a public servant.</p> <hr /> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td><b><i>Updates Pt. 1</i></b></p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The letter isn’t a list of his latest achievements, rather a description of how he has grown as a person since the last update.</span></i></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specific examples of actions he has been taking to help his community.</span></i></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Restating his driving intent and purpose.</span></i></li> </ul> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <hr /> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have remained dedicated to my scholastic pursuits and community, in two months I will graduate having received </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">straight A’s during my senior year and as a member of the Cum Laude society</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">More importantly, as the senior class president, I have worked to assuage the frustration and confusion that I’ve felt in my peers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Much like I did as an intern, I’ve served as a bridge between my school’s administration in New York and our seniors who have returned home around the world. I send regular updates about our yearbook, graduation, and our move to online schooling. It’s heartbreaking to know that we will not see each other for the rest of the year, but with the help of my peers, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve started to devise ways of holding senior events, like our commencement, over Zoom to maintain some sense of togetherness</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This crisis has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">taught me that regardless of one’s age or position in life, by being involved and offering a helping hand, anyone can have a positive impact on their community.</span></p> <hr /> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td><b><i>Updates Pt. 2</i></b></p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Academic update that reemphasizes his scholastic ability, rigor, and achievements</span></i></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than just a number, Patrick has responsibilities and duties that are important and impactful for his community.</span></i></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though he has submitted his applications, Patrick isn’t just coasting, he’s identifying problems in his community and thinking of novel solutions.</span></i></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reflection, the takeaway for his experiences that he has shared with the reader.

I have been involved in Model UN since eighth grade</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and I can’t think of a better place to keep debating than UChicago. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I visited campus last October. After speaking with my tour guide </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">about the amazing opportunities available to students interested in politics, such as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Institute of Politics Internship and Opportunities Board</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, I knew I had to apply. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">My academic interests stem from policy-making and economic research</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and I am fascinated by the research that comes out of UChicago. I side with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professor Goolsbee and his analysis of the recent $2 trillion economic aid package passed by our government</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.
